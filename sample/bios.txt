Abdelzaher Professor and Willett Faculty Scholar Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Urbana, IL 61801 Tel: (217) 265-6793 Fax: (217) 244-6500 I received my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, in 1999, under Professor Kang Shin . I was an Asistant Professor at the University of Virginia from August 1999 to August 2005. I then joined the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign as an Associate Professor with tenure, where I became Full Professor in 2011. My interests lie primarily in systems, including operating systems, networking, sensor networks, distributed systems, and embedded real-time systems. I am especially interested in developing theory, architectural support, and computing abstractions for predictability in software systems, motivated by the increasing software complexity and the growing sources of non-determinism. Applications range from sensor networks to large-scale server farms, and from transportation systems to medicine. New in Navigation: Green GPS . Brief Biosketch .

 Sarita Adve University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Teaching Research Publications Students Contact Info for Students Fun Stuff Sarita V. Adve Richard T. Cheng Professor Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign sadve@illinois.edu Sarita V. Adve is the Richard T. Cheng Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . Her primary research interest is at the hardware-software interface with work spanning computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and applications. Her current research is on scalable system specialization and approximate computing. Sheco-developed the memory consistency models for the C++ and Java programming languages, which are based on her early work on data-race-free (DRF) models.More recently, her work questioned the conventional wisdom for memory models for heterogeneous systems and showed that DRF is a superior model even for such systems. She is also known for her contributions to cache coherence (she co-developed the simple and efficient DeNovo coherence protocol); hardware reliability (she co-developed software-driven approaches for hardware reliability in the SWAT project and the concept of lifetime reliability aware architectures and dynamic reliability management in the RAMP project); power management (she led the design of GRACE, one of the first systems to implement cross-layer energy management); exploiting instruction-level parallelism (ILP) for memory system performance (she co-authored some of the first papers on exploiting ILP for memory level parallelism); and evaluation techniques for shared-memory multiprocessors with ILP processors (she led the development of the RSIM architecture simulator). Professor Adve received the ACM/IEEE-CS Ken Kennedy award in 2018, was named a Woman of Vision in innovation by the Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology in 2012, an IEEE fellow in 2012, an ACM fellow in 2010, received the ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes award in 2008, an IBM faculty award in 2005, was named a UIUC University Scholar in 2004, received an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in 1998, an IBM University Partnership award in 1997 and 1998, and a National Science Foundation CAREER award in 1995. For three of the last five years (2014-18), Illinois CS has selected her students'PhD theses as one of the department's two nominations for the ACM doctoral dissertation award. She currently serves as the chair of ACM SIGARCH , on the DARPA/ISAT study group, and on ACM Council. She previously served on the board of directors of the Computing Research Association (CRA) (2009-18), on the National Science Foundation's CISE directorate's advisory committee (2003-05), on the expert group to revise the Java memory model (2001-05), and co-led the Intel/Microsoft funded Universal Parallel Computing Research Center (UPCRC) at Illinois as its director of research in its founding year (2008-09). Professor Adve was the first woman of South Asian origin to be named fellow of the ACMand, as a Maurice Wilkes awardee, the first woman to receive a young-, mid-, or life-career award in computer architecture research. She is deeply committed to increasing the number of women in computing by influencing change that can enable more women to be successful at all stages of thecareer pipeline. She received the Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 1993 and 1989 respectively, and the B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay in 1987. Before joining Illinois, she was on the faculty at Rice University from 1993 to 1999. 
 Home Bio Research Publications Research Group Contact Info Engineering at Illinois Vikram S. Adve Donald B. Gillies Professor | Computer Science Department|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Research Projects Prof. Vikram Adve Digital Agriculture: 21st century agriculture presents a number of major challenges and opportunities for computing and engineering: heterogeneous data analysis, IOT and sensor networks, computer vision, robotics,edge computing, machine learning with limited and sparse data but potentially using extensive domain knowledge, and others. I lead the AIFARMS Institute ,a National Artificial Intelligence Research Institute funded by NIFA and NSF, whichis exploring foundational AI challenges and how they can play a role in tackling major agriculture research goals. Edge Computing with HPVM: Many important and emerging application domains require increasingly powerful computing capabilities at the edge of the network, near the sensors, displays and actuators that interact with the physical world. Heterogenous computing with specialized accelerators and often system-on-chip designs are critical to deliver these computing capabilities under tight constraints on memory capacity, compute power, energy, power, weight, and heat dissipation. Building on the HPVM project, we are exploring how compilers, autotuners, and approximate computing techniques can be used to achieve these computing capabilities under such tight resource constraints. We are focusing on three broad edge computing application domains: mobile robots in agriculture, autonomous vehicles, and collaborative AR/VR systems . Heterogeneous Parallel Virtual Machine : A compiler infrastructure and parallel program representationfor heterogeneous parallel systems, with the goal of making it much easier to write performance-portable parallel programs. A single program in the HPVM representation can be compiled to diverse hardware compute units in a heterogeneous system, using the HPVM program representation to target parallelism and data movement. Current targets include GPUs, CPUs with vector extensions, FPGAs, and machine learning accelerators. A major focus of the project is on resource-constrained edge devices, where heterogeneous system-on-chip (SoC) processors with multiple, domain-specific accelerators are routinely used to achieve energy efficiency and performance. We are exploringthe use of automatically tuned approximation algorithms to trade off small amounts of accuracy (or result quality) to achieve reduced energy or higher performance or both. We use three broad application domains as drivers for SoC-based edge computing: autonomous vehicles, small mobile robots, and AR/VR headsets. ALLVM: Exploring the benefits for software performance, security and reliability if all software on a system (either all userspace software or or userspace+OS software) is available in a rich virtual instruction set that can be analyzed and transformed by sophisticated compiler techniques (think Java bytecode, but for all software). Previous Projects The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure : A novel virtual instruction set and compiler infrastructure that enables lifelong analysis and transformation of programs in arbitrary programming languages. LLVM is a key foundation for some of our other ongoing projects, including ALLVM and HPVM. Deterministic-by-default Parallel Programming : Language and compiler techniques to make parallel programming far easier than it is today, by enabling programmers to write provably deterministic parallel programs, and by enforcing that any non-deterministic behavior is made explicit and isolated. SVA: Secure Virtual Architecture : A compiler-based virtual machine for commodity operating systems that can greatly enhance the security and reliability of todays systems. SAFECode: Compiler techniques to enforce memory safety and other safety properties efficiently for unmodified C programs. Automated Debugging for Software Failures : We are developing automated static and dynamic analysis techniques tounderstand the causes of failures in software systems, in order tohelp programmers diagnose and fix software bugs with as little effort as possible. The project is investigating automated fault localization and diagnosis techniques for both standalone and distributed programs.

I am always looking for outstanding graduate or undergraduate students for the projects listed above. More than anything else, I am looking for students who are (a) creative andintellectually strong, and (b) ambitious and hard-working. I take on undergraduates, Masters (MS) students and Ph.D. students. I can generally give Research Assistantships only to Ph.D. students because our research funding is nearly always intended for long term research projects that require a sustained effort over several years. Note that if you join our group as a Ph.D. student, you should not expect to stop after 1.5 or 2 years with an MS degree: the research projects will generally not be appropriate for an MS thesis, which is relatively narrow research. I am willing to take on students interested in an MS for shorter term projects. An MS thesis nearly always must be publishable research, though in exceptional circumstances, I think an MS might be justified for development or experimental work that contributes significantly to one or more of our projects. I am always looking for outstanding undergraduate students interested in research and/or programming experience. I have taken on students ranging from seniors to freshmen: what I look for is someone with an interest in experimental software research, and the drive to work hard and succeed. If you fit these criteria, send me email with a subject line that has the prefix: [Prospective Student] Or, use this link to send me email just so I know you have read this (I am not filtering such email!). Include an up-to-date CV or resum, and say what degree you seek and what project(s) in our group interest you. I will contact you if I want to follow up . I get a lot of such email, so do not take it personally if I do not reply. Thanks for your interest! Log In

 Nikita Borisov Associate Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Publications | Students | CV Request a meeting TripIt - Organize your travel Research Interests Tweets by @hatswitch My research interests are network security and online privacy. There is a natural overlap between these: privacy enhancing technologies can be used by attackers to evade detection, and privacy invasive technologies can be used by network defenders for situational awareness. As a result, the attackers and defenders frequently swap places depending on context, so I named my research group "hatswitch". Teaching Spring'13: CS425/CSE425/ECE428: Distributed Systems.

Brunner is a professor in the School of Information Sciences and in the Department of Accountancy in the College of Business. He has affiliate appointments in the Astronomy, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Informatics, Physics, and Statistics Departments; at the Beckman Institute, in the Computational Science and Engineering program; and at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. He is also the Data Science Expert in Residence at the Research Park at the University of Illinois. His primary research goal focuses on the application of statistical and machine learning to a variety of real-world problems, and in making these efforts easier, faster, and more precise. This work spans fundamental algorithm design to more effectively incorporate uncertainty to optimization using novel computational technologies. More generally, Brunner helps lead efforts to promote data science across campus and to encourage effective data management, analysis, and visualization techniques. Brunner earned his PhD in astrophysics at the Johns Hopkins University working under Alex Szalay on the development of the science archive for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. His PhD thesis helped develop the statistical approach to quantifying galaxy evolution, where large data are used to place constraints on the original and evolution of the Universe. He subsequently spent five years as a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology working under S. George Djorgovsi and Tom Prince as the project scientist for the Digital Sky project. Research Interests Observational Cosmology Information Science Statistical and Machine Learning Advanced Computational Techniques Transient and Variable Phenomena Research Description The development of data science, the application of machine learning, algorithmic optimization, statistical uncertainty and its incorporation in machine learning, data management, effective visualization, and data storytelling.

Our main result is an algorithm for the problem of partitioning the ground set of a given symmetric submodular function f: 2^V --> R into k non-empty parts V_1, V_2, ...,V_k to minimize max_{i in [k]} f(V_i). Our algorithm runs in n^{O(k^2)}T time, where n = |V| and T is the time to evaluate f on a given set; hence, this yields a polynomial time algorithm for any fixed k in the evaluation oracle model. As an immediate corollary, for any fixed k, there is a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem of partitioning a given hypergraph H = (V, E) into k non-empty parts to minimize the maximum capacity of the parts. The complexity of this problem, termed MinMax-Hypergraph-k-Part, was raised by Lawler in 1973 (Networks, Vol. 3, pp 275--285). In contrast to our positive result, a reduction by Chekuri and Li (2015) implies that when k is part of the input, MinMax-Hypergraph-k-Part is hard to approximate to within an almost polynomial factor under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Fixed-Parameter Algorithms for Longest Heapable Subsequence and Maximum Binary Tree (with Elena Grigorescu, Gabriel Istrate, Shubhang Kulkarni, Young-San Lin, Minshen Zhu) (in submission) [Abstract] A heapable sequence is a sequence of numbers that can be arranged in a min-heap data structure. Finding a longest heapable subsequence of a given sequence was proposed by Byers, Heeringa, Mitzenmacher, and Zervas (ANALCO 2011) as a generalization of the well-studied longest increasing subsequence problem and its complexity still remains open. An equivalent formulation of the longest heapable subsequence problem is that of finding a maximum-sized binary tree in a given permutation directed acyclic graph (permutation DAG). In this work, we study parameterized algorithms for both longest heapable subsequence and maximum-sized binary tree. We show the following results: (1) We show that the longest heapable subsequence problem can be solved in k^{O(log{k})}n time, where k is the number of distinct values in the input sequence of length n. (2) We introduce alphabet size as a new parameter in the study of computational problems in permutation DAGs. Our result on longest heapable subsequence implies that the maximum-sized binary tree problem in a given permutation DAG is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the alphabet size. (3) We show that the alphabet size with respect to a fixed topological ordering can be computed in polynomial time, admits a min-max relation, and has a polyhedral description. (4) We show that the maximum-sized binary tree problem in undirected graphs can be solved in w^{O(w)}n time, where w is the treewidth and n is the number of vertices in the input graph. Our results make progress towards understanding the complexity of longest heapable subsequence and maximum-sized binary tree problems from the perspective of parameterized algorithms. We believe that the parameter alphabet size that we introduce is likely to be useful in the context of optimization problems defined over permutation DAGs. Analyzing Residual Random Greedy for monotone submodular maximization (with Kristf Brczi, Tams Kirly, Aditya Pillai) (in submission) [Abstract] Residual Random Greedy (RRGreedy) is a natural randomized version of the greedy algorithm for submodular maximization. It was introduced to address non-monotone submodular maximization (Buchbinder, Feldman, Naor, Schwartz, SODA 2014) and plays an important role in the deterministic algorithm for monotone submodular maximization that beats the (1/2)-factor barrier (Buchbinder, Feldman, Garg, IPCO 2019). In this work, we analyze RRGreedy for monotone submodular functions along two fronts: (1) For matroid constrained maximization of submodular functions with bounded curvature alpha, we show that RRGreedy achieves a (1/(1+alpha))-approximation irrespective of the randomness in the algorithm. In particular, this implies that it achieves a (1/2)-approximation always (not just in expectation). (2) We generalize RRGreedy to k>=2 matroid constraints and show that the generalization achieves a (1/(k+1))-approximation in expectation relative to the optimum value of the Lovasz extension over the intersection of k matroid polytopes. Our results suggest that RRGreedy is at least as good as Greedy for matroid and matroid intersection constraints. Experimental study of hypergraph min-cut and min k-cut algorithms (with Victor Sui) (in submission) [Abstract] The minimum k-cut problem in hypergraphs (for fixed k) asks for a k-partition of the vertex set with minimum number of crossing hyperedges. The case of k = 2 corresponds to the global min-cut problem in hypergraphs. Global min-cut is solvable using ordering based algorithms while the min k-cut problem was open until recently. In the last few years, several new algorithms have emerged in this area: (1) constructing t-trimmed certificates in polynomial-time, (2) near linear-time (2+epsilon)-approximation, and (3) min k-cut in randomized polynomial-time. These exciting developments for hypergraphs have been important theoretical steps in bringing the status of hypergraph cuts and k-cuts to almost match that of graphs. In this work, we provide efficient implementations and conduct an experimental evaluation of these recently developed algorithms as well as ordering based algorithms for hypergraphs. We also develop hypergraph families for testing min k-cut and min-cut algorithms. Our work leads to a better understanding of the practical performance of these algorithms. Hypergraph k-cut for fixed k in deterministic polynomial time (with Chandra Chekuri) (To appear in) IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2020 [Abstract] We consider the Hypergraph-k-cut problem. The input consists of a hypergraph G = (V, E) with non-negative hyperedge-costs c: E->R_+ and a positive integer k. The objective is to find a least-cost subset F of hyperedges of E such that the number of connected components in G - F is at least k. An alternative formulation of the objective is to find a partition of V into k non-empty sets V_1, V_2, ..., V_k so as to minimize the cost of the hyperedges that cross the partition. Graph-k-cut, the special case of Hypergraph-k-cut obtained by restricting to graph inputs, has received considerable attention. Several different approaches lead to a polynomial-time algorithm for Graph-k-cut when k is fixed, starting with the work of Goldschmidt and Hochbaum (1988). In contrast, it is only recently that a randomized polynomial time algorithm for Hypergraph-k-cut was developed (Chandrasekaran, Xu, Yu, SODA 2018) via a subtle generalization of Karger's random contraction approach for graphs. In this work, we develop the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for Hypergraph-k-cut for all fixed k. We describe two algorithms both of which are based on a divide and conquer approach. The first algorithm is simpler and runs in n^{O(k^2)} time while the second one runs in n^{O(k)} time. Our proof relies on new structural results that allow for efficient recovery of the parts of an optimum k-partition by solving minimum (s,t)-terminal cuts. Our techniques give new insights even for Graph-k-cut. The Maximum Binary Tree Problem (with Elena Grigorescu, Gabriel Istrate, Shubhang Kulkarni, Young-San Lin, Minshen Zhu) (To appear in) European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA), 2020. [arXiv] | [Abstract] We introduce and investigate the approximability of the maximum binary tree problem (MBT) in directed and undirected graphs. The goal in MBT is to find a maximum-sized binary tree in a given graph. MBT is a natural variant of the well-studied longest path problem, since both can be viewed as finding a maximum-sized tree of bounded degree in a given graph. The connection to longest path motivates the study of MBT in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), since the longest path problem is solvable efficiently in DAGs. In contrast, we show that MBT in DAGs is in fact hard: it has no efficient exp(-O(log n/ log log n))-approximation algorithm under the exponential time hypothesis, where n is the number of vertices in the input graph. In undirected graphs, we show that MBT has no efficient exp(-O(log^{0.63}{n}))-approximation under the exponential time hypothesis. Our inapproximability results rely on self-improving reductions and structural properties of binary trees. We also show constant-factor inapproximability under the P neq NP assumption. In addition to inapproximability results, we present algorithmic results along two different flavors: (1) We design a randomized algorithm to verify if a given directed graph on n vertices contains a binary tree of size k in 2^k poly(n) time. (2) Motivated by the longest heapable subsequence problem, introduced by Byers, Heeringa, Mitzenmacher, and Zervas, (ANALCO 2011), which is equivalent to MBT in permutation DAGs, we design efficient algorithms for MBT in bipartite permutation graphs. Multicriteria cuts and size-constrained k-cuts in hypergraphs (with Calvin Beideman, Chao Xu) (To appear in) International Conference on Randomization and Computation (RANDOM), 2020. [arXiv] | [Abstract] We address counting and optimization variants of multicriteria global min-cut and size-constrained min-k-cut in hypergraphs. 1. For an r-rank n-vertex hypergraph endowed with t hyperedge-cost functions, we show that the number of multiobjective min-cuts is O(r2^{tr}n^{3t-1}). In particular, this shows that the number of parametric min-cuts in constant rank hypergraphs for a constant number of criteria is strongly polynomial, thus resolving an open question by Aissi, Mahjoub, McCormick, and Queyranne (Math Programming, 2015). In addition, we give randomized algorithms to enumerate all multiobjective min-cuts and all pareto-optimal cuts in strongly polynomial-time. 2. We also address node-budgeted multiobjective min-cuts: For an n-vertex hypergraph endowed with t vertex-weight functions, we show that the number of node-budgeted multiobjective min-cuts is O(r2^{r}n^{t+2}), where r is the rank of the hypergraph, and the number of node-budgeted b-multiobjective min-cuts for a fixed budget-vector b is O(n^2). 3. We show that min-k-cut in hypergraphs subject to constant lower bounds on part sizes is solvable in polynomial-time for constant k, thus resolving an open problem posed by Queyranne. Our technique also shows that the number of optimal solutions is polynomial. All of our results build on the random contraction approach of Karger (SODA, 1993). Our techniques illustrate the versatility of the random contraction approach to address counting and algorithmic problems concerning multiobjective min-cuts and size-constrained k-cuts in hypergraphs. Spectral Aspects of Symmetric Matrix Signings (with Charles Carlson, Hsien-Chih Chang, Naonori Kakimura, Alexandra Kolla) Preliminary version in Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (MFCS), 2019. Discrete Optimization , 2020. [arXiv] | [Abstract] The spectra of signed matrices have played a fundamental role in social sciences, graph theory, and control theory. In this work, we investigate the computational problems of finding symmetric signings of matrices with natural spectral properties. Our results are the following: 1. We characterize matrices that have an invertible signing: a symmetric matrix has an invertible symmetric signing if and only if the support graph of the matrix contains a perfect 2-matching. Further, we present an efficient algorithm to search for an invertible symmetric signing. 2. We use the above-mentioned characterization to give an algorithm to find a minimum increase in the support of a given symmetric matrix so that it has an invertible symmetric signing. 3. We show NP-completeness of the following problems: verifying whether a given matrix has a symmetric off-diagonal signing that is singular/has bounded eigenvalues. However, we also illustrate that the complexity could differ substantially for input matrices that are adjacency matrices of graphs. We use combinatorial techniques in addition to classic results from matching theory. Improving the Integrality Gap for Multiway Cut (with Kristf Brczi, Tams Kirly, Vivek Madan) Preliminary version in Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization (IPCO), 2019. Mathematical Programming , 2020. [arXiv] | [Abstract] In the multiway cut problem, we are given an undirected graph with non-negative edge weights and a collection of k terminal nodes, and the goal is to partition the node set of the graph into k non-empty parts each containing exactly one terminal so that the total weight of the edges crossing the partition is minimized. The multiway cut problem for k>=3 is APX-hard. For arbitrary k, the best-known approximation factor is 1.2965 due to Sharma and Vondrak while the best known inapproximability factor is 1.2 due to Angelidakis, Makarychev and Manurangsi. In this work, we improve on the lower bound to 1.20016 by constructing an integrality gap instance for the CKR relaxation. A technical challenge in improving the gap has been the lack of geometric tools to understand higher-dimensional simplices. Our instance is a non-trivial 3-dimensional instance that overcomes this technical challenge. We analyze the gap of the instance by viewing it as a convex combination of 2-dimensional instances and a uniform 3-dimensional instance. We believe that this technique could be exploited further to construct instances with larger integrality gap. One of the byproducts from our proof technique is a generalization of a result on Sperner admissible labelings due to Mirzakhani and Vondrak that might be of independent combinatorial interest. Improving the smoothed complexity of FLIP for max cut problems (with Ali Bibak, Charles Carlson) ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), 2019. [arXiv] | [Abstract] Finding locally optimal solutions for max-cut and max-k-cut are well-known PLS-complete problems. An instinctive approach to finding such a locally optimum solution is the FLIP method. Even though FLIP requires exponential time in worst-case instances, it tends to terminate quickly in practical instances. To explain this discrepancy, the run-time of FLIP has been studied in the smoothed complexity framework. Etscheid and Rglin [ER17] showed that the smoothed complexity of FLIP for max-cut in arbitrary graphs is quasi-polynomial. Angel, Bubeck, Peres, and Wei [ABPW17] showed that the smoothed complexity of FLIP for max-cut in complete graphs is O(phi^5 n^15.1), where phi is an upper bound on the random edge-weight density and n is the number of vertices in the input graph. While Angel et al.s result showed the first polynomial smoothed complexity, they also conjectured that their run-time bound is far from optimal. In this work, we make substantial progress towards improving the run-time bound. We prove that the smoothed complexity of FLIP in complete graphs is O(phi n^(7.83)). Our results are based on a carefully chosen matrix whose rank captures the run-time of the method along with improved rank bounds for this matrix and an improved union bound based on this matrix. In addition, our techniques provide a general framework for analyzing the FLIP method in the smoothed framework. We illustrate this general framework by showing that the smoothed complexity of FLIP for max-3-cut in complete graphs is polynomial and for max-k-cut in arbitrary graphs is quasi-polynomial. We believe that our techniques should also be of interest towards addressing the smoothed complexity of FLIP for max-k-cut in complete graphs for larger constants k. Beating the 2-approximation factor for global bicut (with Kristf Brczi, Tams Kirly, Euiwoong Lee, Chao Xu) Mathematical Programming , 2019. [Abstract] In the fixed-terminal bicut problem, the input is a directed graph with two specified nodes s and t and the goal is to find a smallest subset of edges whose removal ensures that s cannot reach t and t cannot reach s. In the global bicut problem, the input is a directed graph and the goal is to find a smallest subset of edges whose removal ensures that there exist two nodes s and t such that s cannot reach t and t cannot reach s. Fixed-terminal bicut and global bicut are natural extensions of {s,t}-min cut and global min-cut respectively, from undirected graphs to directed graphs. Fixed-terminal bicut is NP-hard, admits a simple 2-approximation, and does not admit a (2-eps)-approximation for any constant eps>0 assuming the unique games conjecture. In this work, we show that global bicut admits a (2-1/448)-approximation, thus improving on the approximability of the global variant in comparison to the fixed-terminal variant. Additive Stabilizers for Unstable Graphs (with Corinna Gottschalk, Jochen Knemann, Britta Peis, Daniel Schmand, Andreas Wierz) Discrete Optimization , 2019. [arXiv] | [Abstract] Stabilization of graphs has received substantial attention in recent years due to its connection to game theory. Stable graphs are exactly the graphs inducing a matching game with non-empty core. They are also the graphs that induce a network bargaining game with a balanced solution. A graph with weighted edges is called stable if the maximum weight of an integral matching equals the cost of a minimum fractional weighted vertex cover. If a graph is not stable, it can be stabilized in different ways. Recent papers have considered the deletion or addition of edges and vertices in order to stabilize a graph. In this work, we focus on a fine-grained stabilization strategy, namely stabilization of graphs by fractionally increasing edge weights. We show the following results for stabilization by minimum weight increase in edge weights (min additive stabilizer): (i) Any approximation algorithm for min additive stabilizer that achieves a factor of O(|V|^(1/24-eps)) for eps>0 would lead to improvements in the approximability of densest-k-subgraph. (ii) Min additive stabilizer has no o(log|V|) approximation unless NP=P. Results (i) and (ii) together provide the first super-constant hardness results for any graph stabilization problem. On the algorithmic side, we present (iii) an algorithm to solve min additive stabilizer in factor-critical graphs exactly in poly-time, (iv) an algorithm to solve min additive stabilizer in arbitrary-graphs exactly in time exponential in the size of the Tutte set, and (v) a poly-time algorithm with approximation factor at most O(sqrt(|V|)) for a super-class of the instances generated in our hardness proofs. Lattice-based Locality Sensitive Hashing is Optimal (with Daniel Dadush, Venkata Gandikota, Elena Grigorescu) Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS), 2018. [Abstract] Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) was introduced by Indyk and Motwani (STOC '98) to give the first sublinear time algorithm for the $c$-approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) problem using only polynomial space. At a high level, LSH family hashes "nearby" points to the same bucket and "far away" points to different buckets. The quality of measure of an LSH family is its LSH exponent, which helps determine both the query time and space usage. In a seminal work, Andoni and Indyk (FOCS '06) constructed an LSH family based on random ball partitionings of space that achieves an LSH exponent of 1/c^2 for the l_2-norm, which was later shown to be optimal by O'Donnell, Wu and Zhou (TOCT '14). Although optimal in the LSH exponent, the ball partitioning approach is computationally expensive. So, in the same work, Andoni and Indyk proposed a simpler and more practical hashing scheme based on Euclidean lattices and provided computational results using the 24-dimensional Leech lattice. However, no theoretical analysis of the scheme was given, thus leaving open the question of finding the exponent of lattice based LSH. In this work, we resolve this question by showing the existence of lattices achieving the optimal LSH exponent of 1/c^2 using techniques from the geometry of numbers. At a more conceptual level, our results show that optimal LSH space partitions can have periodic structure. Understanding the extent to which additional structure can be imposed on these partitions, e.g. to yield low space and query complexity, remains an important open problem. Hypergraph k-cut in randomized polynomial time (with Chao Xu, Xilin Yu) Preliminary version in ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), 2018. Mathematical Programming , 2019. [Abstract] In the hypergraph k-cut problem, the input is a hypergraph, and the goal is to find a smallest subset of hyperedges whose removal ensures that the remaining hypergraph has at least k connected components. This problem is known to be at least as hard as the densest k-subgraph problem when k is part of the input (Chekuri-Li, 2015). We present a randomized polynomial time algorithm to solve the hypergraph k-cut problem for constant k. Our algorithm solves the more general hedge k-cut problem when the subgraph induced by every hedge has a constant number of connected components. In the hedge k-cut problem, the input is a hedgegraph specified by a vertex set and a disjoint set of hedges, where each hedge is a subset of edges defined over the vertices. The goal is to find a smallest subset of hedges whose removal ensures that the number of connected components in the remaining underlying (multi-)graph is at least k. Our algorithm is based on random contractions akin to Karger's min cut algorithm. Our main technical contribution is a distribution over the hedges (hyperedges) so that random contraction of hedges (hyperedges) chosen from the distribution succeeds in returning an optimum solution with large probability. A tight 2 -approximation for Linear 3-Cut (with Kristf Brczi, Tams Kirly, Vivek Madan) Preliminary version in ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), 2018. Mathematical Programming , 2019. [Abstract] We investigate the approximability of the linear 3-cut problem in directed graphs, which is the simplest unsolved case of the linear k-cut problem. The input here is a directed graph D=(V,E) with node weights and three specified terminal nodes s, r, t in V, and the goal is to find a minimum weight subset of non-terminal nodes whose removal ensures that s cannot reach r and t, and r cannot reach t. The problem is approximation-equivalent to the problem of blocking rooted in- and out-arborescences, and it also has applications in network coding and security. The approximability of linear 3-cut has been wide open until now: the best known lower bound under the Unique Game Conjecture (UGC) was 4/3, while the best known upper bound was 2 using a trivial algorithm. In this work we completely close this gap: we present a 2 -approximation algorithm and show that this factor is tight assuming UGC. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we analyze a natural two-step deterministic rounding scheme through the lens of a single-step randomized rounding scheme with non-trivial distributions, and (2) we construct integrality gap instances that meet the upper bound of 2 . Our gap instances can be viewed as a weighted graph sequence converging to a "graph limit structure". Graph Stabilization: A Survey Combinatorial Optimization and Graph Algorithms: Communications of NII Shonan Meetings , 2017. [Abstract] Graph stabilization has raised a family of network design problems that has received considerable attention recently. Stable graphs are those graphs for which the matching game has non-empty core. In the optimization terminology, they are graphs for which the fractional matching linear program has an integral optimum solution. Graph stabilization involves minimally modifying a given graph to make it stable. In this survey, we outline recent developments in graph stabilization and highlight some open problems. Odd Multiway Cut in Directed Acyclic Graphs (with Sahand Mozaffari) Preliminary version in International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation (IPEC), 2017. SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics , 2020. [arXiv] | [Abstract] We investigate the odd multiway node (edge) cut problem where the input is a graph with a specified collection of terminal nodes and the goal is to find a smallest subset of non-terminal nodes (edges) to delete so that the terminal nodes do not have an odd length path between them. In earlier work, Lokshtanov and Ramanujan showed that both odd multiway node cut and odd multiway edge cut are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the size of the solution in undirected graphs. In this work, we focus on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and design a fixed-parameter algorithm. Our main contribution is an extension of the shadow-removal framework for parity problems in DAGs. We complement our FPT results with tight approximability as well as polyhedral results for 2 terminals in DAGs. Additionally, we show inapproximability results for odd multiway edge cut in undirected graphs even for 2 terminals. Global and fixed-terminal cuts in digraphs (with Kristf Brczi, Tams Kirly, Euiwoong Lee, Chao Xu) International Workshop on Approximation Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization Problems (APPROX), 2017. [arXiv] | [Abstract] The computational complexity of multicut-like problems may vary significantly depending on whether the terminals are fixed or not. In this work we present a comprehensive study of this phenomenon in two types of cut problems in directed graphs: double cut and bicut. 1. The fixed-terminal edge-weighted double cut is known to be solvable efficiently. We show a tight approximability factor of 2 for the fixed-terminal node-weighted double cut. We show that the global node-weighted double cut cannot be approximated to a factor smaller than 3/2 under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). 2. The fixed-terminal edge-weighted bicut is known to have a tight approximability factor of 2. We show that the global edge-weighted bicut is approximable to a factor strictly better than 2, and that the global node-weighted bicut cannot be approximated to a factor smaller than 3/2 under UGC. 3. In relation to these investigations, we also prove two results on undirected graphs which are of independent interest. First, we show NP-completeness and a tight inapproximability bound of 4/3 for the node-weighted 3-cut problem. Second, we show that for constant k, there exists an efficient algorithm to solve the minimum {s,t}-separating k-cut problem. Our techniques for the algorithms are combinatorial, based on LPs and based on enumeration of approximate min-cuts. Our hardness results are based on combinatorial reductions and integrality gap instances. On the Expansion of Group-Based Lifts (with Naman Agarwal, Alexandra Kolla, Vivek Madan) Preliminary version in International Workshop on Randomization and Computation (RANDOM), 2017. SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics , 2019. [arXiv] | [Abstract] A k-lift of an n-vertex base graph G is a graph H on n x k vertices, where each vertex v of G is replaced by k vertices v_1,...,v_k and each edge uv in G is replaced by a matching representing a bijection pi_{uv} so that the edges of H are of the form (u_i,v_{pi_{uv}(i)}). Lifts have been investigated as a means to efficiently construct expanders. In this work, we study lifts obtained from groups and group actions. We derive the spectrum of such lifts via the representation theory principles of the underlying group. Our main results are: (1) A uniform random lift by a cyclic group of order k of any n-vertex d-regular base graph G, with the nontrivial eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of G bounded by lambda in magnitude, has the new nontrivial eigenvalues bounded by lambda+O(sqrt{d}) in magnitude with probability 1-ke^{-Omega(n/d^2)}. The probability bounds as well as the dependency on lambda are almost optimal. As a special case, we obtain that there is a constant c_1 such that for every k<=2^{c_1n/d^2}, there exists a lift H of every Ramanujan graph by a cyclic group of order k such that H is almost Ramanujan (nontrivial eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix at most O(sqrt{d}) in magnitude). This result leads to a quasi-polynomial time deterministic algorithm to construct almost Ramanujan expanders. (2) There is a constant c_2 such that for every k>=2^{c_2nd}, there does NOT exist an abelian k-lift H of any n-vertex d-regular base graph such that H is almost Ramanujan. This can be viewed as an analogue of the well-known no-expansion result for constant degree abelian Cayley graphs. Suppose k_0 is the order of the largest abelian group that produces expanding lifts. Our two results highlight lower and upper bounds on k_0 that are tight upto a factor of d^3 in the exponent, thus suggesting a threshold phenomenon. Shift Lifts Preserving Ramanujan Property (with Ameya Velingker) Linear Algebra and its Applications , 2017. [arXiv] | [Abstract] In a breakthrough work, Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava recently showed that every d-regular bipartite Ramanujan graph has a 2-lift that is also d-regular bipartite Ramanujan. As a consequence, a straightforward iterative brute-force search algorithm leads to the construction of a d-regular bipartite Ramanujan graph on N vertices in time 2^O(dN). Shift k-lifts studied by Agarwal-Kolla-Madan lead to a natural approach for constructing Ramanujan graphs more efficiently. The number of possible shift k-lifts of a d-regular n-vertex graph is k^(nd/2). Suppose the following holds for k=2^{\Omega(n)}: There exists a shift k-lift that maintains the Ramanujan property of d-regular bipartite graphs on n vertices for all n. ---- (*) Then, by performing a similar brute-force search, one would be able to construct an N-vertex bipartite Ramanujan graph in time 2^O(dlog^2 N). Furthermore, if (*) holds for all k>=2, then one would obtain an algorithm that runs in poly(N^d) time. In this work, we take a first step towards proving (*) by showing the existence of shift k-lifts that preserve the Ramanujan property in d-regular bipartite graphs for k=3, 4. Local Testing for Membership in Lattices (with Mahdi Cheraghchi, Venkata Gandikota, Elena Grigorescu) Preliminary version in Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science (FSTTCS), 2016. SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics , 2018. [arXiv] | [Abstract] Motivated by the structural analogies between point lattices and linear error-correcting codes, and by the mature theory on locally testable codes, we initiate a systematic study of local testing for membership in lattices. Testing membership in lattices is also motivated in practice, by applications to integer programming, error detection in lattice-based communication, and cryptography. Apart from establishing the conceptual foundations of lattice testing, our results include the following: 1. We demonstrate upper and lower bounds on the query complexity of local testing for the well-known family of code formula lattices. Furthermore, we instantiate our results with code formula lattices constructed from Reed-Muller codes, and obtain nearly-tight bounds. 2. We show that in order to achieve low query complexity, it is sufficient to design one-sided non-adaptive canonical tests. This result is akin to, and based on an analogous result for error-correcting codes due to Ben-Sasson et al. (SIAM J. Computing 35(1) pp 1-21). Deciding Orthogonality in Construction-A Lattices (with Venkata Gandikota, Elena Grigorescu) Preliminary version in Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science (FSTTCS), 2015. SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics , 2017. [arXiv] | [Abstract] Lattices are discrete mathematical objects with widespread applications to integer programs as well as modern cryptography. A fundamental problem in both domains is the Closest Vector Problem (popularly known as CVP). It is well-known that CVP can be easily solved in lattices that have an orthogonal basis if the orthogonal basis is specified. This motivates the orthogonality decision problem: verify whether a given lattice has an orthogonal basis. Surprisingly, the orthogonality decision problem is not known to be either NP-complete or in P. In this work, we focus on the orthogonality decision problem for a well-known family of lattices, namely Construction A lattices. These are lattices of the form C+qZ^n, where C is an error-correcting q-ary code, and are studied in communication settings. We provide a complete characterization of lattices obtained from binary and ternary codes using Construction A that have an orthogonal basis. This characterization leads to an efficient algorithm solving the orthogonality decision problem, which also finds an orthogonal basis if one exists for this family of lattices. We believe that these results could provide a better understanding of the complexity of the orthogonality decision problem in general. Finding Small Stabilizers for Unstable Graphs (with Adrian Bock, Jochen Knemann, Britta Peis, Laura Sanit) Preliminary version in Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization (IPCO), 2014. Mathematical Programming , Vol. 154, Issue 1, 2015. [Abstract] An undirected graph G=(V,E) is stable if the cardinality of a maximum matching equals the size of a minimum fractional vertex cover. We call a set of edges F subseteq E to be a stabilizer if its removal from G yields a stable graph. In this paper we study the following natural edge-deletion question: given a graph G=(V,E), can we find a minimum-cardinality stabilizer? Stable graphs play an important role in cooperative game theory. In the classic matching game introduced by Shapley and Shubik (Int J Game Theory 1(1):111---130, 1971) we are given an undirected graph G=(V,E) where vertices represent players, and we define the value of each subset S subseteq V as the cardinality of a maximum matching in the subgraph induced by S. The core of such a game contains all fair allocations of the value of V among the players, and is well-known to be non-empty iff graph G is stable. The stabilizer problem addresses the question of how to modify the graph to ensure that the core is non-empty. We show that this problem is vertex-cover hard. We prove that every minimum-cardinality stabilizer avoids some maximum matching of G. We use this insight to give efficient approximation algorithms for sparse graphs and for regular graphs. Finding a Most Biased Coin with Fewest Flips (with Richard Karp) Conference on Learning Theory (COLT), 2014. [arXiv] | [Abstract] We study the problem of learning a most biased coin among a set of coins by tossing the coins adaptively. The goal is to minimize the number of tosses until we identify a coin whose posterior probability of being most biased is at least 1 - delta for a given delta. Under a particular probabilistic model, we give an optimal algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that minimizes the expected number of future tosses. The problem is closely related to finding the best arm in the multi-armed bandit problem using adaptive strategies. Our algorithm employs an optimal adaptive strategy--a strategy that performs the best possible action at each step after observing the outcomes of all previous coin tosses. Consequently, our algorithm is also optimal for any given starting history of outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that employs an optimal adaptive strategy under a Bayesian setting for this problem. Our proof of optimality employs mathematical tools from the area of Markov games. Faster Private Release of Marginals on Small Databases (with Justin Thaler, Jonathan Ullman, Andrew Wan) Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS), 2014. [arXiv] | [Abstract] We study the problem of answering k-way marginal queries on a database D in ({0,1}^d)^n, while preserving differential privacy. The answer to a k-way marginal query is the fraction of the database's records x in {0,1}^d with a given value in each of a given set of up to k columns. Marginal queries enable a rich class of statistical analyses on a dataset, and designing efficient algorithms for privately answering marginal queries has been identified as an important open problem in private data analysis. For any k, we give a differentially private online algorithm that runs in time poly(n, min{ exp(d^{1-Omega(1/sqrt{k})}), exp(d / \log^{.99} d) } ) per query and answers any (adaptively chosen) sequence of poly(n) k-way marginal queries with error at most +/- .01 on every query, provided n >= d^{.51}. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm capable of privately answering marginal queries with a non-trivial worst-case accuracy guarantee for databases containing poly(d, k) records in time exp(o(d)). Our algorithm runs the private multiplicative weights algorithm (Hardt and Rothblum, FOCS) on a new approximate polynomial representation of the database. We derive our representation for the database using techniques from approximation theory. More concretely, our representation uses approximations to the OR function by low-degree polynomials with coefficients of bounded L_1-norm. We derive our representation for the database by approximating the OR function restricted to low Hamming weight inputs using low-degree polynomials with coefficients of bounded L_1-norm. In doing so, we show new upper and lower bounds on the degree of such polynomials, which may be of independent approximation-theoretic interest. First, we construct a polynomial that approximates the d-variate OR function on inputs of Hamming weight at most k such that the degree of the polynomial is at most d^{1-Omega(1/sqrt{k})} and the L_1-norm of its coefficient vector is d^{0.01}. Then we show the following lower bound that exhibits the tightness of our approach: for any k = o(log d), any polynomial whose coefficient vector has L_1-norm poly(d) that pointwise approximates the d-variate OR function on all inputs of Hamming weight at most k must have degree d^{1-O(1/sqrt{k})}. Integer Feasibility of Random Polytopes (with Santosh Vempala) Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS), 2014. [pdf] | [Abstract] We study integer programming instances over polytopes P(A,b)={x:Ax<=b} where the constraint matrix A is random, i.e., its entries are i.i.d. Gaussian or, more generally, its rows are i.i.d. from a spherically symmetric distribution. The radius of the largest inscribed ball is closely related to the existence of integer points in the polytope. We show that for m=2^O(sqrt{n}), there exist constants c_0 < c_1 such that with high probability, random polytopes are integer feasible if the radius of the largest ball contained in the polytope is at least c_1sqrt{log(m/n)}; and integer infeasible if the largest ball contained in the polytope is centered at (1/2,...,1/2) and has radius at most c_0sqrt{log(m/n)}. Thus, random polytopes transition from having no integer points to being integer feasible within a constant factor increase in the radius of the largest inscribed ball. We show integer feasibility via a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for finding an integer point in the polytope. Our main tool is a simple new connection between integer feasibility and linear discrepancy. We extend a recent algorithm for finding low-discrepancy solutions (Lovett-Meka, FOCS '12) to give a constructive upper bound on the linear discrepancy of random matrices. By our connection between discrepancy and integer feasibility, this upper bound on linear discrepancy translates to the radius lower bound that guarantees integer feasibility of random polytopes. The Cutting Plane Method is Polynomial for Perfect Matchings (with Lszl Vgh, Santosh Vempala) Preliminary version in IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2012. Mathematics of Operations Research , Vol. 41, No. 1, 2016. [pdf] | [Abstract] The cutting plane approach to optimal matchings has been discussed by several authors over the past decades (Padberg and Rao, Grotschel and Holland, Lovasz and Plummer, Trick, Fischetti and Lodi), and its convergence has been an open question. We prove that the cutting plane approach using Edmonds' blossom inequalities converges in polynomial time for the minimum-cost perfect matching problem. Our main insight is an LP-based method to retain/drop cuts. This careful cut retention procedure leads to a sequence of intermediate linear programs with a linear number of constraints whose optima are half-integral and supported by a disjoint union of odd cycles and edges. This structural property of the optima is instrumental in finding violated blossom inequalities (cuts) in linear time. Further, the number of cycles in the support of the half-integral optima acts as a potential function to show efficient convergence to an integral solution. ***[With an appendix section giving a provably efficient combinatorial perfect matching algorithm in which all intermediate solutions are half-integral.]*** Algorithms for Implicit Hitting Set Problems (with Richard Karp, Erick Moreno-Centeno, Santosh Vempala) ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), 2011. [pdf] | [Abstract] Motivated by instances of the hitting set problem where the number of sets to be hit is large, we introduce the notion of implicit hitting set problems. In an implicit hitting set problem the collection of sets to be hit is typically too large to list explicitly; instead, an oracle is provided which, given a set H, either determines that H is a hitting set or returns a set that H does not hit. We show a number of examples of classic implicit hitting set problems, and give a generic algorithm for solving such problems optimally. The main contribution of this paper is to show that this framework is valuable in developing approximation algorithms. We illustrate this methodology by presenting a simple on-line algorithm for the minimum feedback vertex set problem on random graphs. In particular our algorithm gives a feedback vertex set of size n-(1/p) log np(1-o(1)) with probability at least 3/4 for the random graph G(n,p) (the smallest feedback vertex set is of size n-(2/p) log np(1 + o(1))). We also consider a planted model for the feedback vertex set in directed random graphs. Here we show that a hitting set for a polynomial-sized subset of cycles is a hitting set for the planted random graph and this allows us to exactly recover the planted feedback vertex set. Satisfiability Thresholds for k-CNF Formula with Bounded Variable Intersections (with Navin Goyal, Bernhard Haeupler) [arXiv] | [Abstract] We determine the thresholds for the number of variables, number of clauses, number of clause intersection pairs and the maximum clause degree of a k-CNF formula that guarantees satisfiability under the assumption that every two clauses share at most alpha variables. More formally, we call these formulas alpha-intersecting and define, for example, a threshold mu_i(k,alpha) for the number of clause intersection pairs i, such that every alpha-intersecting k-CNF formula in which at most mu_i(k,alpha) pairs of clauses share a variable is satisfiable and there exists an unsatisfiable alpha-intersecting k-CNF formula with mu_m(k,alpha) such intersections. We provide a lower bound for these thresholds based on the Lovasz Local Lemma and a nearly matching upper bound by constructing an unsatisfiable k-CNF to show that mu_i(k,alpha) = Theta(2^{k(2+1/alpha)})$. Similar thresholds are determined for the number of variables (mu_n = Theta(2^{k/alpha})) and the number of clauses (mu_m = Theta(2^{k(1+(1/alpha))})) (see [Scheder08] for an earlier but independent report on this threshold). Our upper bound construction gives a family of unsatisfiable formula that achieve all four thresholds simultaneously. Deterministic Algorithms for the Lovsz Local Lemma (with Navin Goyal, Bernhard Haeupler) Preliminary version in ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), 2010. SIAM Journal on Computing , Vol. 42, Issue 6, 2013. [pdf] | [Abstract] Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL) is a powerful result in probability theory that is often used for non-constructive existence proofs of combinatorial structures. A prominent application is to k-CNF formulas, where LLL implies that if every clause in a formula shares variables with at most d<=2^k/e other clauses then such a formula has a satisfying assignment. Recently, a randomized algorithm to efficiently construct a satisfying assignment in this setting was given by Moser. Subsequently Moser and Tardos gave a general algorithmic framework for LLL and a randomized algorithm to construct the structures guaranteed by LLL. In this paper we address the main problem left open by Moser and Tardos of derandomizing this algorithm efficiently. Our algorithm works in the general framework of Moser--Tardos with a minimal loss in parameters. For the special case of constructing satisfying assignments for k-CNF formulas, for any epsilon in (0, 1) we give a deterministic algorithm that finds a satisfying assignment for any k-CNF formula with m clauses and d<=2^k/(1+epsilon) /e in time \tilde{O}(m^(2(1+1/{lower case epsilon})). This improves upon the deterministic algorithms of Moser and of Moser-Tardos with running times m^(Omega(k^2)) and m^(Omega(k/epsilon)) which are superpolynomial for k = omega(1) and upon other previous algorithms which work only for d<=2^(k/16)/e. Our algorithm is the first deterministic algorithm that works in the general framework of Moser--Tardos. Lastly we show how to obtain an NC, i.e., fully parallel, algorithm for the same setting. Thin Partitions: Isoperimetric Inequalities and Sampling Algorithms for some Nonconvex Families (with Daniel Dadush, Santosh Vempala) ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), 2010. [pdf] | [Abstract] Star-shaped bodies are an important nonconvex generalization of convex bodies (e.g., linear programming with violations). Here we present an efficient algorithm for sampling a given star-shaped body. The complexity of the algorithm grows polynomially in the dimension and inverse polynomially in the fraction of the volume taken up by the kernel of the star-shaped body. The analysis is based on a new isoperimetric inequality. Our main technical contribution is a tool for proving such inequalities when the domain is not convex. As a consequence, we obtain a polynomial algorithm for computing the volume of such a set as well. In contrast, linear optimization over star-shaped sets is NP-hard. Sampling s-Concave functions (with Amit Deshpande, Santosh Vempala) International Workshop on Randomization and Computation (RANDOM), 2009. [pdf] | [Abstract] Efficient sampling, integration and optimization algorithms for logconcave functions rely on the good isoperimetry of these functions. We extend this to show that -1/(n-1)-concave functions have good isoperimetry, and moreover, using a characterization of functions based on their values along every line, we prove that this is the largest class of functions with good isoperimetry in the spectrum from concave to quasi-concave. We give an efficient sampling algorithm based on a random walk for -1/(n-1)-concave probability densities satisfying a smoothness criterion, which includes heavy-tailed densities such as the Cauchy density. In addition, the mixing time of this random walk for Cauchy density matches the corresponding best known bounds for logconcave densities. An Observation about Variations of the Diffie-Hellman Assumption (with Raghav Bhaskar, Satya V. Lokam, Peter L. Montgomery, Ramarathnam Venkatesan, Yacov Yacobi) Serdica Journal of Computing , Vol 3, No. 3, 2009. [pdf] | [Abstract] We generalize the Strong Boneh-Boyen (SBB) signature scheme to sign vectors (GSBB).

Kevin C.C. Chang is a Professor in Computer Science , University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , where he leads the FORWARD Data Lab for search, integration, and mining of data. He received a BS from National Taiwan University and PhD from Stanford University , in Electrical Engineering. His research addresses large scale information access, for search, mining, and integration across structured and unstructured big data, with current focuses on "entity-centric" Web search/mining and social media analytics. He received two Best Paper Selections in VLDB 2000 and 2013, an NSF CAREER Award in 2002, an NCSA Faculty Fellow Award in 2003, IBM Faculty Awards in 2004 and 2005, Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Faculty Fellow Award in 2008, and the Incomplete List of Excellent Teachers at University of Illinois in 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2010, and 2011. He is passionate to bring research results to the real world and, with his students, co-founded Cazoodle , a startup from the University of Illinois, for deepening vertical "data-aware" search over the web. Research. I lead the FORWARD Group , which is part of the larger Data and Information Systems Laboratories , at the CS department of UIUC. Our research overall aims at bridging structured and unstructured big data --- to bring structured/semantic-rich access to the myriad and massive unstructured data which accounts for most of the world's information. Therefore, o ur research spans across data mining, data management/databases , information retrieval, machine learning , with current efforts focusing on interactive data management , entity-centric Web search and mining , social media analytics, and social network mining . As our objectives, we aim at developing novel systems, principled algorithms, and formal theories that ultimately deliver real world applications. As our approaches, we seek to be inspired by and learn from the data we are tackling-- i.e., we believe the key to tame big data is to learn the wisdom hidden in the large scale of the data.

Chen Named EiC of ACM TRETS Chen Elevated as IEEE Fellow Inspirit IoT Received SBIR Award More... Dr. Deming Chen obtained his BS in computer science from University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1995, and his MS and PhD in computer science from University of California at Los Angeles in 2001 and 2005 respectively. He worked as a software engineer between 1995-1999 and 2001-2002. He joined the ECE department of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2005 and has been a full professor in the same department since 2015. He is a research professor in the Coordinated Science Laboratory and an affiliate professor in the CS department. He has published more than 200 refereed journal and conference papers, and book or book chapters in the areas of FPGA (synthesis, computing, architecture), EDA (system-level/high-level/logic synthesis), Machine Learning (acceleration, IoT system, algorithm), Heterogeneous Computing (hybrid systems of CPU/FPGA/GPU), and Nanotechnology (device modeling and nano-circuits). In the recent years, he is also actively involved with other research directions, such as computational genomics and computation in smart grid. He has served as PI/Co-PI on more than 40 research grants administered by US Federal agencies as well as the industry. In addition, he has been a seconded faculty member for the Illinois ADSC center in Singapore since March 2010, supervising a very active research group there. He has received nine Best Paper Awards (ASPDAC'09, SASP'09, FCCM'11, SAAHPC'11, CODES+ISSS'13, ICCAD'15, SLIP'18, ICCAD'18, and VLSID'20) and numerous other awards. To name several current projects, he has been leading the successful FCUDA project in the past 10 years that uses CUDA language to program FPGAs, offering opportunity to map existing CUDA kernels to FPGAs for low-energy and high-performance computing. Now, the FCUDA flow is open source and available for downloading under the Software Release menu. Another signature project is a new DNA error correction tool, called BLESS, that offers the best error-correction quality among the current state-of-the-art tools targeting large DNA data, but only consumes 40X smaller memory compared to other tools. BLESS has been downloaded for ~3000 times from researchers and users around the world. The most recent representative open-source packages include: RIP , which includes fast software modeling (320x faster than Gem5), fast hardware modeling (2000x faster than baseline), and near-optimal automated hardware/software partitioning for complext SoC designs; Cloud-DNN , which is an open-source framework that maps DNN (deep neural network) models to FPGAs in the cloud for inference acceleration; and DNNBuilder , which represents the best FPGA implementation of DNNs for both edge and cloud computing use cases. Dr. Chen was involved in two startup companies. He implemented his published algorithm on CPLD technology mapping when he was a software engineer in Aplus Design Technologies, Inc. in 2001, and the software was exclusively licensed by Altera and distributed to many customers of Altera worldwide. He is one of the inventors of the xPilot High-level Synthesis package developed at UCLA, which was licensed to AutoESL Design Technologies, Inc. Aplus was acquired by Magma in 2003, and AutoESL was acquired by Xilinx in 2011. Currently, he is the Chairman of the Board for a new startup Inspirit IoT, Inc. , headquartered in the Research Park at Champaign, IL. He also actively provides consulting services or short courses for leading semiconductor or FPGA computing companies. Dr. Chen is an IEEE Fellow, an ACM Distinguished Speaker, and the Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS). 2014-20 Deming Chen. All rights reserved.

Family! I'm a computational geometer/topologist/graphophile with more general interests in algorithms, data structures, and lower bounds. I teach mostly large algorithms classes ; you might find my free textbook and other course materials useful. Exactly half of my former PhD students have tenure. From 2013 to 2016, Iwas an associate department head and chair of the faculty recruiting committee. I am a SafeTOC advocate . Ihave the lowest undergraduate GPA (2.4/4.0) of any professor I've ever met, although some of my colleagues came close, and a few others never finished college at all. (Ireally shouldn't be proud of that.) Only three other professors have been in my department longer than I have. (Ireally shouldn't be proud of that, either.) Praxis tendatum docebit.

Read more about my candiacy here. IEEE Computer Society I am the 2020 VP for Technical and Conference Activities. Research Interests My interest is in the use of high performance computing to solve problems that are too hard for other techniques. I have concentrated in two areas: the development of scalable numerical algorithms for partial differential equations (PDEs), especially for the linear systems that arise from approximations to PDEs, and the development of programming models and systems for expressing and implementing highly scalable applications. In each of these areas, I have led the development of software that has been widely adopted. PETSc is a powerful numerical library for the solution of linear and nonlinear systems of equations. MPI is the mostly widely used parallel programming system for large scale scientific computing. The MPICH implementation of MPI is one of the most widely used and is the implementation of choice for the world's fastest machines. A new interest is the development of a Deep Learning Major Research Instrument Project , which combines my interests in HPC software and numerics and high-performance I/O with the revolution in machine learning. Research Opportunities I have an active research program and currently have openings for graduate students and scientific programmers. One project, the Center for the Exascale simulation of plasma-coupled compustion , is winding down, and is not taking any new students. New opportunities in performance modeling, code generation and tuning, and scalable algorithms, are available for a soon-to-be-announced project. Stay tuned! Of Special Interest 2016 Ken Kennedy Lecture at SC16. Our report on Future Directions for NSF Advanced Computing Infrastructure to Support U.S. Science and Engineering in 2017-2020 is now available! The report is freely available at that link, and provides a framework for NSF's advanced computing for the future (not just until 2020). Video of lectures at the 2016 ATPESC . Using MPI, 3rd edition and Using Advanced MPI released! Using MPI is an extensive revision, including new material on MPI-2.2 and MPI-3. Using Advanced MPI is a replacement for Using MPI-2 , and includes new material on the MPI-3 one-sided interface, the new tools interface, and Fortran, as well as extensive revisions throughout. Now available: The SC13 opening session video , including award presentations and Genevieve Bell's keynote.

This paper learns and leverages such semantic cues for navigating to objects of interest in novel environments, by simply watching YouTube videos. This is challenging because YouTube videos do not come with labels for actions or goals, and may not even showcase optimal behavior. Our proposed method tackles these challenges through the use of Q-learning on pseudo-labeled transition quadruples (image, action, next image, reward). Our experiments in visually realistic simulations demonstrate that such off-policy Q-learning from passive data is able to learn meaningful semantic cues for navigation. These cues, when used in a hierarchical navigation policy, lead to improved efficiency for goal reaching, and are able to improve upon end-to-end RL based methods by 66%, while at the same time using 250 times fewer interaction samples. Code, dataset, and models will be made available. @article{chang2020semantic, author = "Chang, Matthew and Gupta, Arjun and Gupta, Saurabh", title = "Semantic Visual Navigation by Watching YouTube Videos", journal = "arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.10034", year = "2020" } Semantic Curiosity for Active Visual Learning Devendra Chaplot*, Helen Jiang*, Saurabh Gupta , Abhinav Gupta European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020 abstract / bibtex / webpage / arxiv link In this paper, we study the task of embodied interactive learning for object detection. Given a set of environments (and some labeling budget), our goal is to learn an object detector by having an agent select what data to obtain labels for. How should an exploration policy decide which trajectory should be labeled? One possibility is to use a trained object detector's failure cases as an external reward. However, this will require labeling millions of frames required for training RL policies, which is infeasible. Instead, we explore a self-supervised approach for training our exploration policy by introducing a notion of semantic curiosity. Our semantic curiosity policy is based on a simple observation -- the detection outputs should be consistent. Therefore, our semantic curiosity rewards trajectories with inconsistent labeling behavior and encourages the exploration policy to explore such areas. The exploration policy trained via semantic curiosity generalizes to novel scenes and helps train an object detector that outperforms baselines trained with other possible alternatives such as random exploration, prediction-error curiosity, and coverage-maximizing exploration. @inproceedings{chaplot2020semantic, author = "Chaplot, Devendra Singh and Jiang, Helen and Gupta, Saurabh and Gupta, Abhinav", title = "Semantic Curiosity for Active Visual Learning", year = "2020", booktitle = "European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)" } Aligning Videos in Space and Time Senthil Purushwalkam*, Tian Ye*, Saurabh Gupta , Abhinav Gupta European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020 abstract / bibtex / arxiv link In this paper, we focus on the task of extracting visual cor- respondences across videos. Given a query video clip from an action class, we aim to align it with training videos in space and time. Obtaining training data for such a fine-grained alignment task is challenging and often ambiguous. Hence, we propose a novel alignment procedure that learns such correspondence in space and time via cross video cycle-consistency. During training, given a pair of videos, we compute cycles that connect patches in a given frame in the first video by matching through frames in the second video. Cycles that connect overlapping patches together are encouraged to score higher than cycles that connect non-overlapping patches. Our experiments on the Penn Action and Pouring datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully learn to correspond semantically similar patches across videos, and learns representations that are sensitive to object and action states. @inproceedings{purushwalkam2020aligning, author = "Purushwalkam, Senthil and Ye, Tian and Gupta, Saurabh and Gupta, Abhinav", title = "Aligning Videos in Space and Time", year = "2020", booktitle = "European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)" } Neural Topological SLAM for Visual Navigation Devendra Chaplot, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Abhinav Gupta, Saurabh Gupta Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020 abstract / bibtex / webpage / video This paper studies the problem of image-goal navigation which involves navigating to the location indicated by a goal image in a novel previously unseen environment. To tackle this problem, we design topological representations for space that effectively leverage semantics and afford approximate geometric reasoning. At the heart of our representations are nodes with associated semantic features, that are interconnected using coarse geometric information. We describe supervised learning-based algorithms that can build, maintain and use such representations under noisy actuation. Experimental study in visually and physically realistic simulation suggests that our method builds effective representations that capture structural regularities and efficiently solve long-horizon navigation problems. We observe a relative improvement of more than 50% over existing methods that study this task. @inproceedings{chaplot2020neural, author = "Chaplot, Devendra Singh and Salakhutdinov, Ruslan and Gupta, Abhinav and Gupta, Saurabh", title = "Neural Topological SLAM for Visual Navigation", year = "2020", booktitle = "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)" } Use the Force, Luke! Learning to Predict Physical Forces by Simulating Effects Kiana Ehsani, Shubham Tulsiani, Saurabh Gupta , Ali Farhadi, Abhinav Gupta Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020 abstract / bibtex / webpage / arxiv link / code+data When we humans look at a video of human-object interaction, we can not only infer what is happening but we can even extract actionable information and imitate those interactions. On the other hand, current recognition or geometric approaches lack the physicality of action representation. In this paper, we take a step towards a more physical understanding of actions. We address the problem of inferring contact points and the physical forces from videos of humans interacting with objects. One of the main challenges in tackling this problem is obtaining ground-truth labels for forces. We sidestep this problem by instead using a physics simulator for supervision. Specifically, we use a simulator to predict effects and enforce that estimated forces must lead to the same effect as depicted in the video. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that (a) we can predict meaningful forces from videos whose effects lead to accurate imitation of the motions observed, (b) by jointly optimizing for contact point and force prediction, we can improve the performance on both tasks in comparison to independent training, and (c) we can learn a representation from this model that generalizes to novel objects using few shot examples. @inproceedings{ehsani2020force, author = "Ehsani, Kiana and Tulsiani, Shubham and Gupta, Saurabh and Farhadi, Ali and Gupta, Abhinav", title = "Use the Force, Luke!

We leverage the fact that mmWave signals have favorable propagation characteristics in low visibility conditions, unlike optical sensors like cameras and LiDARs which cannot penetrate through dense fog. Millimeter wave radars, however, suffer from very low resolution, specularity, and noise artifacts. We introduce HawkEye, a system that leverages a cGAN architecture to recover high-frequency shapes from raw low-resolution mmWave heatmaps. We propose a novel design that addresses challenges specific to the structure and nature of the radar signals involved. We also develop a data synthesizer to aid with large-scale dataset generation for training. We implement our system on a custom-built mmWave radar platform and demonstrate performance improvement over both standard mmWave radars and other competitive baselines. @inproceedings{guan2020through, author = "Guan, Junfeng and Madani, Sohrab and Jog, Suraj and Gupta, Saurabh and Hassanieh, Haitham", title = "Through Fog High Resolution Imaging Using Millimeter Wave Radar", year = "2020", booktitle = "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)" } Efficient Bimanual Manipulation Using Learned Task Schemas Rohan Chitnis, Shubham Tulsiani, Saurabh Gupta , Abhinav Gupta International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2020 abstract / bibtex / video We address the problem of effectively composing skills to solve sparse-reward tasks in the real world. Given a set of parameterized skills (such as exerting a force or doing a top grasp at a location), our goal is to learn policies that invoke these skills to efficiently solve such tasks. Our insight is that for many tasks, the learning process can be decomposed into learning a state-independent task schema (a sequence of skills to execute) and a policy to choose the parameterizations of the skills in a state-dependent manner. For such tasks, we show that explicitly modeling the schema's state-independence can yield significant improvements in sample efficiency for model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. Furthermore, these schemas can be transferred to solve related tasks, by simply re-learning the parameterizations with which the skills are invoked. We find that doing so enables learning to solve sparse-reward tasks on real-world robotic systems very efficiently. We validate our approach experimentally over a suite of robotic bimanual manipulation tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware. @inproceedings{chitnis2020efficient, author = "Chitnis, Rohan and Tulsiani, Shubham and Gupta, Saurabh and Gupta, Abhinav", title = "Efficient Bimanual Manipulation Using Learned Task Schemas", booktitle = "International Conference on Robotics and Automation", year = "2020" } Intrinsic Motivation for Encouraging Synergistic Behavior Rohan Chitnis, Shubham Tulsiani, Saurabh Gupta , Abhinav Gupta International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2020 abstract / bibtex / webpage We study the role of intrinsic motivation as an exploration bias for reinforcement learning in sparse-reward synergistic tasks, which are tasks where multiple agents must work together to achieve a goal they could not individually. Our key idea is that a good guiding principle for intrinsic motivation in synergistic tasks is to take actions which affect the world in ways that would not be achieved if the agents were acting on their own. Thus, we propose to incentivize agents to take (joint) actions whose effects cannot be predicted via a composition of the predicted effect for each individual agent. We study two instantiations of this idea, one based on the true states encountered, and another based on a dynamics model trained concurrently with the policy. While the former is simpler, the latter has the benefit of being analytically differentiable with respect to the action taken. We validate our approach in robotic bimanual manipulation tasks with sparse rewards; we find that our approach yields more efficient learning than both 1) training with only the sparse reward and 2) using the typical surprise-based formulation of intrinsic motivation, which does not bias toward synergistic behavior.

Our approach leverages the strengths of both classical and learning-based methods, by using analytical path planners with learned mappers, and global and local policies. Use of learning provides flexibility with respect to input modalities (in mapper), leverages structural regularities of the world (in global policies), and provides robustness to errors in state estimation (in local policies). Such use of learning within each module retains its benefits, while at the same time, hierarchical decomposition and modular training allow us to sidestep the high sample complexities associated with training end-to-end policies. Our experiments in visually and physically realistic simulated 3D environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach over past learning and geometry-based approaches. @inproceedings{chaplot2020learning, author = "Chaplot, Devendra Singh and Gupta, Saurabh and Gandhi, Dhiraj and Gupta, Abhinav and Salakhutdinov, Ruslan", title = "Learning To Explore Using Active Neural Mapping", booktitle = "International Conference on Learning Representations", year = "2020", url = "https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HklXn1BKDH" } Learning to Move With Affordance Maps William Qi, Ravi Mullapudi, Saurabh Gupta , Deva Ramanan International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2020 abstract / bibtex / code / openreview link The ability to autonomously explore and navigate a physical space is a fundamental requirement for virtually any mobile autonomous agent, from household robotic vacuums to autonomous vehicles. Traditional SLAM-based approaches for exploration and navigation largely focus on leveraging scene geometry, but fail to model dynamic objects (such as other agents) or semantic constraints (such as wet floors or doorways). Learning-based RL agents are an attractive alternative because they can incorporate both semantic and geometric information, but are notoriously sample inefficient, difficult to generalize to novel settings, and are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we combine the best of both worlds with a modular approach that {\em learns} a spatial representation of a scene that is trained to be effective when coupled with traditional geometric planners. Specifically, we design an agent that learns to predict a spatial affordance map that elucidates what parts of a scene are navigable through active self-supervised experience gathering. In contrast to most simulation environments that assume a static world, we evaluate our approach in the VizDoom simulator, using large-scale randomly-generated maps containing a variety of dynamic actors and hazards. We show that learned affordance maps can be used to augment traditional approaches for both exploration and navigation, providing significant improvements in performance. @inproceedings{qi2020learning, author = "Qi, William and Mullapudi, Ravi Teja and Gupta, Saurabh and Ramanan, Deva", title = "Learning to Move with Affordance Maps", booktitle = "International Conference on Learning Representations", year = "2020", url = "https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJgMFxrYPB" } 2019 Learning Navigation Subroutines by Watching Videos Ashish Kumar, Saurabh Gupta , Jitendra Malik Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2019 abstract / bibtex / website / arXiv link / code Hierarchies are an effective way to boost sample efficiency in reinforcement learning, and computational efficiency in classical planning. However, acquiring hierarchies via hand-design (as in classical planning) is suboptimal, while acquiring them via end-to-end reward based training (as in reinforcement learning) is unstable and still prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we pursue an alternate paradigm for acquiring such hierarchical abstractions (or visuo-motor subroutines), via use of passive first-person observation data. We use an inverse model trained on small amounts of interaction data to pseudo-label the passive first person videos with agent actions. Visuo-motor subroutines are acquired from these pseudo-labeled videos by learning a latent intent-conditioned policy that predicts the inferred pseudo-actions from the corresponding image observations. We demonstrate our proposed approach in context of navigation, and show that we can successfully learn consistent and diverse visuo-motor subroutines from passive first-person videos. We demonstrate the utility of our acquired visuo-motor subroutines by using them as is for exploration, and as sub-policies in a hierarchical RL framework for reaching point goals and semantic goals. We also demonstrate behavior of our subroutines in the real world, by deploying them on a real robotic platform. @inproceedings{kumar2019learning, author = "Kumar, Ashish and Gupta, Saurabh and Malik, Jitendra", title = "Learning Navigation Subroutines by Watching Videos", booktitle = "Conference on Robot Learning", year = "2019" } Combining Optimal Control and Learning for Visual Navigation in Novel Environments Somil Bansal, Varun Tolani, Saurabh Gupta , Jitendra Malik, Claire Tomlin Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2019 abstract / bibtex / website / code Model-based control is a popular paradigm for robot navigation because it can leverage a known dynamics model to efficiently plan robust robot trajectories. However, it is challenging to use model-based methods in settings where the environment is apriori unknown and can only be observed partially through on-board sensors on the robot. In this work, we address this short-coming by coupling model-based control with learning-based perception. The learning-based perception module produces a series of waypoints that guide the robot to the goal via a collision-free path. These waypoints are used by a model-based planner to generate a smooth and dynamically feasible trajectory that is executed on the physical system using feedback control. Our experiments in simulated real-world cluttered environments and on an actual ground vehicle demonstrate that the proposed approach can reach goal locations more reliably and efficiently in novel, previously-unknown environments as compared to a purely end-to-end learning-based alternative. Our approach, which we refer to as WayPtNav (WayPoint-based Navigation), is successfully able to exhibit goal-driven behavior without relying on detailed explicit 3D maps of the environment, works well with low frame rates, and generalizes well from simulation to the real world. @inproceedings{bansal2019combining, author = "Bansal, Somil and Tolani, Varun and Gupta, Saurabh and Malik, Jitendra and Tomlin, Claire", title = "Combining Optimal Control and Learning for Visual Navigation in Novel Environments", booktitle = "Conference on Robot Learning", year = "2019" } Learning Exploration Policies for Navigation Tao Chen, Saurabh Gupta , Abhinav Gupta International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019 abstract / bibtex / website / arXiv link Numerous past works have tackled the problem of task-driven navigation. But, how to effectively explore a new environment to enable a variety of down-stream tasks has received much less attention. In this work, we study how agents can autonomously explore realistic and complex 3D environments without the context of task-rewards. We propose a learning-based approach and investigate different policy architectures, reward functions, and training paradigms. We find that use of policies with spatial memory that are bootstrapped with imitation learning and finally finetuned with coverage rewards derived purely from on-board sensors can be effective at exploring novel environments. We show that our learned exploration policies can explore better than classical approaches based on geometry alone and generic learning-based exploration techniques. Finally, we also show how such task-agnostic exploration can be used for down-stream tasks.

Our proposed architecture learns to map from first-person views and plans a sequence of actions towards goals in the environment. The Cognitive Mapper and Planner (CMP) is based on two key ideas: a) a unified joint architecture for mapping and planning, such that the mapping is driven by the needs of the task, and b) a spatial memory with the ability to plan given an incomplete set of observations about the world. CMP constructs a top-down belief map of the world and applies a differentiable neural net planner to produce the next action at each time step. The accumulated belief of the world enables the agent to track visited regions of the environment. We train and test CMP on navigation problems in simulation environments derived from scans of real world buildings. Our experiments demonstrate that CMP outperforms alternate learning-based architectures, as well as, classical mapping and path planning approaches in many cases. Furthermore, it naturally extends to semantically specified goals, such as "going to a chair". We also deploy CMP on physical robots in indoor environments, where it achieves reasonable performance, even though it is trained entirely in simulation. @article{gupta2019cognitive, author = "Gupta, Saurabh and Tolani, Varun and Davidson, James and Levine, Sergey and Sukthankar, Rahul and Malik, Jitendra", title = "Cognitive mapping and planning for visual navigation", journal = "International Journal of Computer Vision", year = "2019" } PyRobot: An Open-Source Robotics Framework for Research and Benchmarking Adithyavairavan Murali*, Tao Chen*, Kalyan Vasudev Alwala*, Dhiraj Gandhi*, Lerrel Pinto, Saurabh Gupta , Abhinav Gupta arXiv, 2019 abstract / bibtex / arXiv link / pyrobot code / locobot robot / pyrobot tutorial This paper introduces PyRobot, an open-source robotics framework for research and benchmarking. PyRobot is a light-weight, high-level interface on top of ROS that provides a consistent set of hardware independent mid-level APIs to control different robots. PyRobot abstracts away details about low-level controllers and inter-process communication, and allows non-robotics researchers (ML, CV researchers) to focus on building high-level AI applications. PyRobot aims to provide a research ecosystem with convenient access to robotics datasets, algorithm implementations and models that can be used to quickly create a state-of-the-art baseline.

Recent computer vision research has demonstrated that Mask R-CNN can be trained to segment specific categories of objects in RGB images when massive hand-labeled datasets are available. As generating these datasets is time consuming, we instead train with synthetic depth images. Many robots now use depth sensors, and recent results suggest training on synthetic depth data can transfer successfully to the real world. We present a method for automated dataset generation and rapidly generate a synthetic training dataset of 50,000 depth images and 320,000 object masks using simulated heaps of 3D CAD models. We train a variant of Mask R-CNN with domain randomization on the generated dataset to perform category-agnostic instance segmentation without any hand-labeled data and we evaluate the trained network, which we refer to as Synthetic Depth (SD) Mask R-CNN, on a set of real, high-resolution depth images of challenging, densely-cluttered bins containing objects with highly-varied geometry. SD Mask R-CNN outperforms point cloud clustering baselines by an absolute 15% in Average Precision and 20% in Average Recall on COCO benchmarks, and achieves performance levels similar to a Mask R-CNN trained on a massive, hand-labeled RGB dataset and fine-tuned on real images from the experimental setup. We deploy the model in an instance-specific grasping pipeline to demonstrate its usefulness in a robotics application. Code, the synthetic training dataset, and supplementary material are available online. @inproceedings{danielczuk2019segmenting, author = "Danielczuk, Michael and Matl, Matthew and Gupta, Saurabh and Li, Andrew and Lee, Andrew and Mahler, Jeffrey and Goldberg, Ken", title = "Segmenting unknown {3D} objects from real depth images using mask {R-CNN} trained on synthetic point clouds", booktitle = "International Conference on Robotics and Automation", year = "2019" } 2018 Visual Memory for Robust Path Following Ashish Kumar*, Saurabh Gupta* , David Fouhey, Sergey Levine, Jitendra Malik Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2018 abstract / bibtex / webpage Humans routinely retrace paths in a novel environment both forwards and backwards despite uncertainty in their motion. This paper presents an approach for doing so. Given a demonstration of a path, a first network generates a path abstraction. Equipped with this abstraction, a second network observes the world and decides how to act to retrace the path under noisy actuation and a changing environment. The two networks are optimized end-to-end at training time. We evaluate the method in two realistic simulators, performing path following and homing under actuation noise and environmental changes.

Our proposed formulation is learned from data and is thus able to leverage statistical regularities of the world. This allows it to efficiently navigate in novel environments given only a sparse set of registered images as input for building representations for space. Our formula- tion is based on three key ideas: a learned path planner that outputs path plans to reach the goal, a feature synthesis engine that predicts features for locations along the planned path, and a learned goal-driven closed loop controller that can follow plans given these synthesized features.

We use learned representations from a large labeled modality as supervisory signal for training representations for a new unlabeled paired modality. Our method enables learning of rich representations for unlabeled modalities and can be used as a pre-training procedure for new modalities with limited labeled data. We transfer supervision from labeled RGB images to unlabeled depth and optical flow images and demonstrate large improvements for both these cross modal supervision transfers. @inproceedings{gupta2016cross, author = "Gupta, Saurabh and Hoffman, Judy and Malik, Jitendra", title = "Cross modal distillation for supervision transfer", booktitle = "Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", pages = "2827--2836", year = "2016" } Learning With Side Information Through Modality Hallucination Judy Hoffman, Saurabh Gupta , Trevor Darrell Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016 abstract / bibtex We present a modality hallucination architecture for training an RGB object detection model which incorporates depth side information at training time. Our convolutional hallucination network learns a new and complementary RGB image representation which is taught to mimic convolutional mid-level features from a depth network. At test time images are processed jointly through the RGB and hallucination networks to produce improved detection performance. Thus, our method transfers information commonly extracted from depth training data to a network which can extract that information from the RGB counterpart.

Given labeled depth images for a handful of categories we adapt an RGB object detector for a new category such that it can now use depth images in addition to RGB images at test time to produce more accurate detections. Our approach is built upon the observation that lower layers of a CNN are largely task and category agnostic and domain specific while higher layers are largely task and category specific while being domain agnostic. We operationalize this observation by proposing a mid-level fusion of RGB and depth CNNs. Experimental evaluation on the challenging NYUD2 dataset shows that our proposed adaptation technique results in an average 21% relative improvement in detection performance over an RGB-only baseline even when no depth training data is available for the particular category evaluated. We believe our proposed technique will extend advances made in computer vision to RGB-D data leading to improvements in performance at little additional annotation effort. @inproceedings{hoffman2016cross, author = "Hoffman, Judy and Gupta, Saurabh and Leong, Jian and Guadarrama, Sergio and Darrell, Trevor", title = "Cross-modal adaptation for RGB-D detection", booktitle = "Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2016 IEEE International Conference on", pages = "5032--5039", year = "2016", organization = "IEEE" } The Three R's of Computer Vision: Recognition, Reconstruction and Reorganization Jitendra Malik, Pablo Arbelaez, Joao Carreira, Katerina Fragkiadaki, Ross Girshick, Georgia Gkioxari, Saurabh Gupta , Bharath Hariharan, Abhishek Kar, Shubham Tulsiani Pattern Recognition Letters, 2016 abstract / bibtex We argue for the importance of the interaction between recognition, reconstruction and re-organization, and propose that as a unifying framework for computer vision. In this view, recognition of objects is reciprocally linked to re-organization, with bottom-up grouping processes generating candidates, which can be classified using top down knowledge, following which the segmentations can be refined again. Recognition of 3D objects could benefit from a reconstruction of 3D structure, and 3D reconstruction can benefit from object category-specific priors. We also show that reconstruction of 3D structure from video data goes hand in hand with the reorganization of the scene.

We approach this problem by first detecting and segmenting object instances in the scene and then using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the pose of the object. This CNN is trained using pixel surface normals in images containing renderings of synthetic objects. When tested on real data, our method outperforms alternative algorithms trained on real data. We then use this coarse pose estimate along with the inferred pixel support to align a small number of prototypical models to the data, and place into the scene the model that fits best. We observe a 48% relative improvement in performance at the task of 3D detection over the current state-of-the-art, while being an order of magnitude faster. @inproceedings{gupta2015aligning, author = "Gupta, Saurabh and Arbel{\'a}ez, Pablo and Girshick, Ross and Malik, Jitendra", title = "Aligning 3D models to RGB-D images of cluttered scenes", booktitle = "Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", pages = "4731--4740", year = "2015" } Indoor Scene Understanding With RGB-D Images: Bottom-Up Segmentation, Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation Saurabh Gupta , Pablo Arbelaez, Ross Girshick, Jitendra Malik International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2015 abstract / bibtex / code / dev code In this paper, we address the problems of contour detection, bottom-up grouping, object detection and semantic segmentation on RGB-D data. We focus on the challenging setting of cluttered indoor scenes, and evaluate our approach on the recently introduced NYU-Depth V2 (NYUD2) dataset. We propose algorithms for object boundary detection and hierarchical segmentation that generalize the gPb-ucm approach by making effective use of depth information. We show that our system can label each contour with its type (depth, normal or albedo). We also propose a generic method for long-range amodal completion of surfaces and show its effectiveness in grouping. We train RGB-D object detectors by analyzing and computing Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) on the depth image and using them with deformable part models (DPM). We observe that this simple strategy for training object detectors significantly outperforms more complicated models in the literature. We then turn to the problem of semantic segmentation for which we propose an approach that classifies superpixels into the dominant object categories in the NYUD2 dataset. We design generic and class-specific features to encode the appearance and geometry of objects. We also show that additional features computed from RGB-D object detectors and scene classifiers further improves semantic segmentation accuracy.

Classical approaches to action recognition either study the task of action classification at the image or video clip level or at best produce a bounding box around the person doing the action. We believe such an output is inadequate and a complete understanding can only come when we are able to associate objects in the scene to the different semantic roles of the action. To enable progress towards this goal, we annotate a dataset of 16K people instances in 10K images with actions they are doing and associate objects in the scene with different semantic roles for each action.

The second model considers more general object detection and uses the spatial relationships between objects and between objects and scenes. Our models are able to capture precise spatial relationships between the context and the object of interest, and make effective use of the appearance of the contextual region.

The word detector outputs serve as conditional inputs to a maximum-entropy language model. The language model learns from a set of over 400,000 image descriptions to capture the statistics of word usage.

The first uses a pipelined process where a set of candidate words is generated by a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on images, and then a maximum entropy (ME) language model is used to arrange these words into a coherent sentence. The second uses the penultimate activation layer of the CNN as input to a recurrent neural network (RNN) that then generates the caption sequence. In this paper, we compare the merits of these different language modeling approaches for the first time by using the same state-ofthe-art CNN as input. We examine issues in the different approaches, including linguistic irregularities, caption repetition, and data set overlap.

We propose a new geocentric embedding for depth images that encodes height above ground and angle with gravity for each pixel in addition to the horizontal disparity. We demonstrate that this geocentric embedding works better than using raw depth images for learning feature representations with convolutional neural networks. Our final object detection system achieves an average precision of 37.3%, which is a 56% relative improvement over existing methods. We then focus on the task of instance segmentation where we label pixels belonging to object instances found by our detector. For this task, we propose a decision forest approach that classifies pixels in the detection window as foreground or background using a family of unary and binary tests that query shape and geocentric pose features. Finally, we use the output from our object detectors in an existing superpixel classification framework for semantic scene segmentation and achieve a 24% relative improvement over current state-of-the-art for the object categories that we study. We believe advances such as those represented in this paper will facilitate the use of perception in fields like robotics. @inproceedings{gupta2014learning, author = "Gupta, Saurabh and Girshick, Ross and Arbel{\'a}ez, Pablo and Malik, Jitendra", title = "Learning rich features from RGB-D images for object detection and segmentation", booktitle = "European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)", pages = "345--360", year = "2014", organization = "Springer, Cham" } 2013 Perceptual Organization and Recognition of Indoor Scenes From RGB-D Images Saurabh Gupta , Pablo Arbelaez, Jitendra Malik Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2013 abstract / bibtex / code / dev code / supp / poster / slides / data We address the problems of contour detection, bottomup grouping and semantic segmentation using RGB-D data. We focus on the challenging setting of cluttered indoor scenes, and evaluate our approach on the recently introduced NYU-Depth V2 (NYUD2) dataset. We propose algorithms for object boundary detection and hierarchical segmentation that generalize the gPb-ucm approach by making effective use of depth information. We show that our system can label each contour with its type (depth, normal or albedo). We also propose a generic method for long-range amodal completion of surfaces and show its effectiveness in grouping. We then turn to the problem of semantic segmentation and propose a simple approach that classifies superpixels into the 40 dominant object categories in NYUD2. We use both generic and class-specific features to encode the appearance and geometry of objects. We also show how our approach can be used for scene classification, and how this contextual information in turn improves object recognition. In all of these tasks, we report signifi- cant improvements over the state-of-the-art. @inproceedings{gupta2013perceptual, author = "Gupta, Saurabh and Arbelaez, Pablo and Malik, Jitendra", title = "Perceptual organization and recognition of indoor scenes from RGB-D images", booktitle = "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2013 IEEE Conference on", pages = "564--571", year = "2013", organization = "IEEE" } A Data Driven Approach for Algebraic Loop Invariants. Rahul Sharma, Saurabh Gupta , Bharath Hariharan, Alex Aiken, Percy Liang, Aditya Nori European Symposium on Programming (ESOP), 2013 abstract / bibtex We describe a Guess-and-Check algorithm for computing algebraic equation invariants. The 'guess' phase is data driven and derives a candidate invariant from data generated from concrete executions of the program. This candidate invariant is subsequently validated in a 'check' phase by an off-the-shelf SMT solver. Iterating between the two phases leads to a sound algorithm. Moreover, we are able to prove a bound on the number of decision procedure queries which Guess-and-Check requires to obtain a sound invariant. We show how Guess-and-Check can be extended to generate arbitrary boolean combinations of linear equalities as invariants, which enables us to generate expressive invariants to be consumed by tools that cannot handle non-linear arithmetic. We have evaluated our technique on a number of benchmark programs from recent papers on invariant generation. Our results are encouraging - we are able to efficiently compute algebraic invariants in all cases, with only a few tests. @inproceedings{sharma2013data, author = "Sharma, Rahul and Gupta, Saurabh and Hariharan, Bharath and Aiken, Alex and Liang, Percy and Nori, Aditya V", title = "A Data Driven Approach for Algebraic Loop Invariants.", booktitle = "ESOP", volume = "13", pages = "574--592", year = "2013" } Verification as Learning Geometric Concepts Rahul Sharma, Saurabh Gupta , Bharath Hariharan, Alex Aiken, Aditya Nori Static Analysis Symposium (SAS), 2013 abstract / bibtex We formalize the problem of program verification as a learning problem, showing that invariants in program verification can be regarded as geometric concepts in machine learning. Safety properties define bad states: states a program should not reach. Program verification explains why a program's set of reachable states is disjoint from the set of bad states. In Hoare Logic, these explanations are predicates that form inductive assertions. Using samples for reachable and bad states and by applying well known machine learning algorithms for classification, we are able to generate inductive assertions. By relaxing the search for an exact proof to classifiers, we obtain complexity theoretic improvements. Further, we extend the learning algorithm to obtain a sound procedure that can generate proofs containing invariants that are arbitrary boolean combinations of polynomial inequalities. We have evaluated our approach on a number of challenging benchmarks and the results are promising. @inproceedings{sharma2013verification, author = "Sharma, Rahul and Gupta, Saurabh and Hariharan, Bharath and Aiken, Alex and Nori, Aditya V", title = "Verification as learning geometric concepts", booktitle = "International Static Analysis Symposium", pages = "388--411", year = "2013", organization = "Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg" } 2012 Semantic Segmentation Using Regions and Parts Pablo Arbelaez, Bharath Hariharan, Chunhui Gu, Saurabh Gupta , Lubomir Bourdev, Jitendra Malik Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012 abstract / bibtex We address the problem of segmenting and recognizing objects in real world images, focusing on challenging articulated categories such as humans and other animals. For this purpose, we propose a novel design for region-based object detectors that integrates efficiently top-down information from scanning-windows part models and global appearance cues. Our detectors produce class-specific scores for bottom-up regions, and then aggregate the votes of multiple overlapping candidates through pixel classification. We evaluate our approach on the PASCAL segmentation challenge, and report competitive performance with respect to current leading techniques. On VOC2010, our method obtains the best results in 6/20 categories and the highest performance on articulated objects. @inproceedings{arbelaez2012semantic, author = "Arbel{\'a}ez, Pablo and Hariharan, Bharath and Gu, Chunhui and Gupta, Saurabh and Bourdev, Lubomir and Malik, Jitendra", title = "Semantic segmentation using regions and parts", booktitle = "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012 IEEE Conference on", pages = "3378--3385", year = "2012", organization = "IEEE" }

Eng. & Comp. Sc., MIT, 1996 Biography Mark Hasegawa-Johnson has been on the faculty at the University of Illinois since 1999, where he is currently a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He received his Ph.D. in 1996 at MIT, with a thesis titled "Formant and Burst Spectral Measures with Quantitative Error Models for Speech Sound Classification," after which he was a post-doc at UCLA from 1996-1999. Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson is a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, and a Senior Member of IEEE and ACM. He is currently Treasurer of ISCA, and Senior Area Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language. He has published 280 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers in the general area of automatic speech analysis, including machine learning models of articulatory and acoustic phonetics, prosody, dysarthria, non-speech acoustic events, audio source separation, and under-resourced languages. Teaching Statement Professor Hasegawa-Johnson typically teaches Artificial Intelligence (CS 440/ECE 448), Multimedia Signal Processing (ECE 417), and Speech and Image Analysis (ECE 401). He has also taughtSpeech Processing (ECE 537), Digital Signal Processing (ECE 551), Audio Engineering (ECE 403), Pattern Recognition (ECE 544NA), and Probability (ECE 313). Research Statement Dr. Hasegawa-Johnson's research is focused on the area of automatic speech recognition, with a particular focus on the mathematization of linguistic concepts. In the past five years, Dr. Hasegawa-Johnson's group has developed mathematical models of concepts from linguistics including a rudimentary model of pre-conscious speech perception (the landmark-based speech recognizer), a model that interprets pronunciation variability by figuring out how the talker planned his or her speech movements (tracking of tract variables from acoustics, and of gestures from tract variables), and a model that uses the stress and rhythm of natural language (prosody) to disambiguate confusable sentences. Recent application successes include: * Speech recognition for talkers with cerebral palsy. The automatic system, suitably constrained, outperforms a human listener. * Retrieval of broadcast television segments in four languages, based on queries specified in the international phonetic alphabet. The Illinois team, including students of Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson and Prof. Huang, took third place in this international competition, and was the only finalist from the United States. * Automatic detection and labeling of non-speech audio events. The Illinois team, including students of Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson and Prof. Huang, took first place in this international competition. * Teaching Chinese. Software and methods developed by Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson, together with his colleagues from Linguistics and Psychology, are being tested in Mandarin language classrooms at the University of Illinois. Undergraduate Research Opportunities Professor Hasegawa-Johnson typically supervises one or two undergraduate research projects per year, thesis research preferred. Past student theses include automatic recognition of musical genre, factorial HMMs for the automatic recognition of speech in music backgrounds, prosody-dependent speech recognition, image source modeling of room impulse response, sonorancy classification for automatic language ID, phonetic landmark detection for automatic language ID, and digital field recorder for acquisition of a natural audio database.

Research Spotlight TRINA personnel protective equipment (PPE) and self-doffing Selected Projects Tele-nursing robots Summary (click to show) Our lab is developing the Tele-Robotic Intelligent Nursing Assistant (TRINA), a remote-controlled robot to perform common nursing duties inside hazardous clinical areas, which could reduce infection risk to healthcare workers by minimizing exposure to contagions and other biohazards. They could also reduce infection risk to immunocompromise patients. Apart from the engineering challenge, we are addressing scientific questions regarding human-robot interfaces, haptics, and semi-autonomous control and planning algorithms. tele-nursing, assisted teleoperation, real-time planning, human-robot interaction NSF RAPID, NSF CAREER Cooperative motion planning for human-operated robots Summary (click to show) This project explores the hypothesis that advances in robot motion planning algorithms will lead to improved intuitiveness, safety, and task performance of human-centered robots such as intelligent vehicles, tele-surgery systems, search-and-rescue robots, and household robots. Existing planning techniques lead to awkward and unintuitive interaction with humans. To bridge this gap, we are developing cooperative motion planning algorithms that reason about users' intended goals and then take control of a robot's low level motion to achieve those goals. NSF CAREER, IU Faculty Research Support Program Autonomous robot packing of complex-shaped objects Summary (click to show) Recently, one area that has attracted a lot of research attention is automated packaging or packing, a process during which robots stow objects into small confined spaces, such as shipping boxes. Packing items densely improves the storage capacity, decreases the delivery cost, and saves packing materials. This project focuses on packing objects of arbitrary shapes, weights, and deformation into a single shipping box with a robot manipulator. We seek to advance the state-of-the-art in robot packing with regards to optimizing container size for a set of objects, planning object placements for stability and feasibility, and increasing robustness of packing execution with a robot manipulator. packing, warehouse automation, optimal planning Amazon Research Award Knowledge- and structure-driven motion planning Summary (click to show) The large motion planning problems that arise in robotics, CAD/CAM, animation of virtual characters, and surgical planning are very challenging: they require searching high-dimensional state spaces with complex geometric constraints, nonlinear dynamics, often with contact and impact, and long time horizons. Prior approaches to these problems either exploit problem structure and/or embed a great deal of domain knowledge by hand into a planner. But this process is tedious, error-prone, and does not scale well to harder problems whose structure is non-obvious. This project will investigate automated strategies for planning systems to automatically discover common solution structures from past experience and to reuse this knowledge in new problems. theory, hybrid motion planning, optimal planning, locomotion NSF Robust Intelligence Program For a complete list, please see the research page.

To achieve this mission, I am currently working to build my capacity as an education researcher while coordinating and leading innovation effortsat the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. About Me I earned my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaignwhile conducting engineering educationresearch. I was co-advised by Michael Loui and Craig Zilles to develop an understanding of how students learn topics in computer engineering and then develop a learning assessment tool called the digital logic concept inventory. I completed two postdocs: one with the Illinois Foundry for Innovation in Engineering Education at the University of Illinois (iFoundry) and one at Purdues School of Engineering Education. With iFoundry I piloted reform projects that centered on improving students intrinsic motivation to learn engineering. At Purdue, I worked with Ruth Streveler (in partnership with Shane Brown at Oregon State University and Holly Matusovich at Virginia Tech) to develop a theory of hot cognition in engineering a theory which argues that cognition can be fully understood only by understanding how cognition is directed by motivation. As a faculty member in Computer Science, I work with the Academy for Excellence in Engineering Education and the Department of Curriculum & Instruction to catalyze change in engineering and computer science education at the University of Illinois. I help lead core college-based change initiatives while continuing my research in students conceptual understanding and change about engineering concepts. A list of my project are below.

Network Security Mechanisms I developed numerous mechanisms for securing routing, origin and path authentication, and efficient algorithms for hash chains. Vehicular Safety Networks Vehicles can avoid accidents through the use of short-range (<1km) position and velocity reporting. My work includes modeling, simulation, performance evaluation, and security evaluation. DDoS Defense The Internet was designed to allow traffic from any sender to reach any destination. Compromised PCs and IoT devices has led to the ability to flood servers with traffic, knocking them offline. I have developed numerous protocols that allow servers to selectively receive traffic. Energy Impacts of Wireless Energy Denial-of-Service is a difficult attack in battery-powered devices. I am exploring ways to join wireless charging with data communication to shift the energy burden onto the requestor, eliminating energy DoS. I've also explored using energy limits to mitigate an energy-limited jammer. Ad Hoc Networks Ad hoc networks route traffic over multiple hops from one host to another to expand the range of a wireless signal. I helped develop numerous features in the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol, as well as security mechanisms for ad hoc network routing. I also developed a secure protocol from the ground up. Train Security Trains pose an interesting security environment: devices are expensive, old, and often cannot be easily retrofit. They also operate in dedicated infrastructure, which can provide distinct wireless properties. Medical Security Explored the same-body detection problem , where two devices will share a key if they are on the same body. I'm generally interested in security issues in health care, especially in the US primary care delivery environment. Publications Book Chapters Andr Weimerskirch , Jason J.

Dr. Jiang got his BS, MS, Ph.D. from ECE@ILLINOIS published more than 30 journal papers and conference proceedings in biosensing and hardware, software system integration. Dr. Jiang was a major contributor to a multi-disciplinary project, Mobosens, a smart-phone based electrochemical sensor, which has won more than $1M prizes including Vodafone wireless innovation award, Nokia sensing XChallenge distinguished award, SBIR, etc. After working in his co-founded startup, LifeFoundry, for 2 years, Dr. Jiang found that coaching and training are the highest leveraging tasks in the world. So he now focuses on education and helps young talents more successful in their study, career, and entrepreneurship. Other Professional Employment CTO & Co-founder, LifeFoundry, Inc.

In order to achieve the goal of educating lifelong learners, creating curiosity is critical. I define curiosity as a powerful tool for students to explore new knowledge in order to satisfy their internal desires. Curiosity is about incubating the desire for students to ask why something happens. Asking why indicates that students are thinking. Then, it is a lot easier for students to get on the journey of exploring theories behind the scenes. Curiosity means having fun while mastering the hurdles. Curiosity injects perseverance into students during the dark times before the sunshine comes. Curiosity is about the desire to appreciate and maximize the benefits of differences. Can you imagine a world where everything is the same? It sounds like the world is going to be so plain. It is the differences that make things pop up. During my teaching career, I have been very curious about the puzzle about how to enable students to learn better. Teaching is also a learning process. I am curious about learning updated thoughts from young students, where I can help students better by understanding them better.

 Alex Kirlik Alex Kirlik Professor (217) 244-8972 kirlik@illinois.edu 4220 Siebel Center for Comp Sci Education Ph.D. Industrial & Systems Engineering, The Ohio State University, 1989. Biography Alex Kirlik is Professor in the Department of Computer Science with additional appointments in the Department of Industrial & Enterprise Systems Engineering, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, and the Information Trust Institute, the Coordinated Science Laboratory, the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory and the Illinois Informatics Institute. He previously served as acting head of Illinois's Human Factors program in the Institute of Aviation from 2006-2010. Alex earned his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Industrial & Systems Engineering (Human-Machine Systems) at The Ohio State University. His Ph.D. thesis, "The organization of perception and action in complex control skills" earned the George Briggs Award from APA's Division of Applied Experimental and Engineering Psychologists, as the best dissertation of the year. During his academic career, in addition to positions held with his home institutions at the University of Illinois (2002-date) and Georgia Tech (1989-2001), Alex has held visiting positions at Stanford University and NASA Ames Research Center (ASEE-NASA Stanford Summer Faculty Fellow, 1989, 1990), Yale University, Haskins Laboratory and the University of Connecticut (Visiting Scholar, 2001-02 academic year), Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, MA (Sabbatical Research, 2012-13 academic year), and the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety (Visiting Scholar, summer 2015). Alex's research interests include human-computer interaction, human factors, visual analytics to support judgment and decision making, human-robot interaction, social computing, human-automation interaction and decision support is sociotechnical systems such as aviation, space, intelligence analysis, severe weather forecasting, disaster and emergency response, healthcare and medicine, autonomous vehicles, education and so forth. Teaching Statement Alex's approach to teaching and mentoring students is naturally dependent of the level of instruction involved. Perhaps one notable aspect of his educational approach is that no crisp line can be drawn between his interests and activities in research and teaching. For example, he has advised 3 PhD dissertations on the development and evaluation of new techniques and technologies for teaching engineering design. His research and educational activities also dovetail in the realm of his graduate seminars, which are intensively group- and project-based, typically involving students in actual research projects to motivate and animate the course material. For example, in 2010 Alex seized on an opportunity afforded by a U.S. Challenge.gov Health and Human Services competition that required competing project teams to design a Facebook app that would be useful to people in the aftermath of natural disasters and emergencies. This project not only involved the students, working as a design team, to create a conceptual design for the app, but to also create a working software prototype and a video demo. The competition was open to any group who wanted to enter it was not specifically targeted to the educational community or to educational institutions. The students design earned 3rd place nationally: www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/02/20120223b.html Research Statement Alex Kirliks research program in human-computer interaction, human factors, and cognitive science & engineering has focused on understanding and supporting the cognition (judgment, decision making, prediction, problem solving and system control), of professionals working in technological workplaces, operational contexts and sociotechnical systems. His research contributing to commercial aviation safety in both airborne and ground operations has been supported by NASA for over 25 years. Recently, aspects of these lines of research have matured into NSF- and NASA-sponsored multidisciplinary projects, joint with collaborators in aerospace, mechanical and software engineering, to create and evaluate formal techniques and general principles for the design of safe and robust cyber-physical-human systems comprised of people and hardware and software automation: Engineering Safety-Critical Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) Systems. The aim of this research, which is relevant to applications not solely in aviation but in contexts such as healthcare and highways, is to achieve levels of human-automation system performance, robustness and safety exceeding what would be achievable by either a human or automation acting alone. A 5-minute public video demo illustrating this work in an aviation context is available at: www.youtube.com/watch . A second major thrust of Alex's research concerns support for judgment and decision making in high-stakes tasks. This line of research developed into an NSF-sponsored project to develop and evaluate quantitative models of judgment in technological systems (e.g., KIrlik, 2006, Adaptive Perspectives on Human-Technology Interaction , NY: Oxford; see: www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780195171822/ ). . Recently, he and his multi-disciplinary team began a 3-year research project involving the design and use of domestic, aerial and ground robotics to support aging-in-place called ASPIRE: Automation Supporting Prolonged Independent Residence for the Elderly, sponsored by the National Robotics Initiative. A brief video showing progress to date, presented at the October, 2016 "Aging 2.0" conference in San Francisco can be viewed at: Also, Alex has co-edited (with J.D. Lee) the first authoritative handbook of its kind, The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Engineering, representing the contributions of more than 60 of the disciplines most influential and accomplished researchers: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Alex often has paid or for-credit undergraduate research opportunities in both human-computer interaction and human factors.

I run the Data Driven Design Group, where my students and I leverage data mining and machine learning to address the central challenge of creating good user experiences: tying design decisions to desired outcomes. I received my BS and PhD from the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University . Based on my dissertation work, I co-founded Apropose, Inc., a data-driven design startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz and New Enterprise Associates . SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Opico: A Study of Emoji-first Communication in a Mobile Social App Sujay Khandekar, Joseph Higgs, Yuanzhe Bian, Chae Won Ryu, Jerry O. Talton, and Ranjitha Kumar Companion Proceedings of WWW '19 In the last two decades, Emoji have become a mainstay of digital communication, allowing ordinary people to convey ideas, concepts, and emotions with just a few Unicode characters. While emoji are most often used to supplement text in digital communication, they comprise a powerful and expressive vocabulary in their own right. In this paper, we study the affordances of 'emoji-first' communication, in which sequences of emoji are used to describe concepts without textual accompaniment. To investigate the properties of emoji-first communication, we built and released Opico, a social media mobile app that allows users to create reactions --- sequences of between one and five emoji --- and share them with a network of friends. We then leveraged Opico to collect a repository of more than 3700 emoji reactions from more than 1000 registered users, each tied to one of 2441 physical places. How do People Sort by Ratings? Jerry O. Talton, Krishna Dusad, Konstantinos Koiliaris, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of CHI '19 Sorting items by user rating is a fundamental interaction pattern of the modern Web, used to rank products (Amazon), posts (Reddit), businesses (Yelp), movies (YouTube), and more. To implement this pattern, designers must take in a distribution of ratings for each item and define a sensible total ordering over them. This is a challenging problem, since each distribution is drawn from a distinct sample population, rendering the most straightforward method of sorting comparing averages unreliable when the samples are small or of different sizes. Several statistical orderings for binary ratings have been proposed in the literature (e.g., based on the Wilson score, or Laplace smoothing), each attempting to account for the uncertainty introduced by sampling. In this paper, we study this uncertainty through the lens of human perception, and ask 'How do people sort by ratings?' In an online study, we collected 48,000 item-ranking pairs from 4,000 crowd workers along with 4,800 rationales, and analyzed the results to understand how users make decisions when comparing rated items. Our results shed light on the cognitive models users employ to choose between rating distributions, which sorts of comparisons are most contentious, and how the presentation of rating information affects users preferences. Learning Design Semantics for Mobile Apps Thomas F. Liu, Mark Craft, Jason Situ, Ersin Yumer, Radomir Mech, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '18 Recently, researchers have developed black-box approaches to mine design and interaction data from mobile apps. Although the data captured during this interaction mining is descriptive, it does not expose the design semantics of UIs: what elements on the screen mean and how they are used. This paper introduces an automatic approach for generating semantic annotations for mobile app UIs. Through an iterative open coding of 73k UI elements and 720 screens, we contribute a lexical database of 25 types of UI components, 197 text button concepts, and 135 icon classes shared across apps. We use this labeled data to learn code-based patterns to detect UI components and to train a convolutional neural network that distinguishes between icon classes with 94% accuracy. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach at scale, we compute semantic annotations for the 72k unique UIs in the Rico dataset, assigning labels for 78% of the total visible, non-redundant elements. Learning Type-Aware Embeddings for Fashion Compatibility Mariya I. Vasileva, Bryan A. Plummer, Krishna Dusad, Shreya Rajpal, Ranjitha Kumar, and David Forsyth Proceedings of ECCV '18 Outfits in online fashion data are composed of items of many different types (e.g. top, bottom, shoes) that share some stylistic relationship with one another. A representation for building outfits requires a method that can learn both notions of similarity (for example, when two tops are interchangeable) and compatibility (items of possibly different type that can go together in an outfit). This paper presents an approach to learning an image embedding that respects item type, and jointly learns notions of item similarity and compatibility in an end-to-end model. To evaluate the learned representation, we crawled 68,306 outfits created by users on the Polyvore website. Our approach obtains 3-5% improvement over the state-of-the-art on outfit compatibility prediction and fill-in-the-blank tasks using our dataset, as well as an established smaller dataset, while supporting a variety of useful queries. Designing the Future of Personal Fashion Kristen Vaccaro, Tanvi Agarwalla, Sunaya Shivakumar, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of CHI '18 Advances in computer vision and machine learning are changing the way people dress, and buy clothes. Given the vast space of fashion problems, where can data-driven technologies provide the most value? To understand consumer pain points and opportunities for technological interventions, this paper presents the results from two independent need-finding studies that explore the gold-standard of personalized shopping: interacting with a personal stylist. Through interviews with five personal stylists, we study the range of problems they address and their in-person processes for working with clients. In a separate study, we investigate how styling experiences map to online settings by building and releasing a chatbot that connects users to one-on-one sessions with a stylist, acquiring more than 70 organic users in three weeks. These conversations reveal that in-person and online styling sessions share similar goals, but online sessions often involve smaller problems that can be resolved more quickly. Based on these explorations, we propose future personalized, online interactions that address consumer trust and uncertainty, and discuss opportunities for automation. ZIPT: Zero-Integration Performance Testing of Mobile App Designs Biplab Deka, Zifeng Huang, Chad Franzen, Jeffrey Nichols, Yang Li, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '17 To evaluate the performance of mobile app designs, designers and researchers employ techniques such as A/B, usability, and analytics-driven testing. While these are all useful strategies for evaluating known designs, comparing many divergent solutions to identify the most performant remains a costly and difficult problem. This paper introduces a design performance testing approach that leverages existing app implementations and crowd workers to enable comparative testing at scale. This approach is manifest in ZIPT, a zero-integration performance testing platform that allows designers to collect detailed design and interaction data over any Android app including apps they do not own and did not build. Designers can deploy scripted tests via ZIPT to collect aggregate user performance metrics (e.g., completion rate, time on task) and qualitative feedback over third-party apps. Through case studies, we demonstrate that designers can use ZIPTs aggregate data and visualizations to understand the relative performance of interaction patterns found in the wild, and identify usability issues in existing Android apps. Rico: A Mobile App Dataset for Building Data-Driven Design Applications Biplab Deka, Zifeng Huang, Chad Franzen, Joshua Hibschman, Daniel Afergan, Yang Li, Jeffrey Nichols, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '17 Data-driven models help mobile app designers understand best practices and trends, and can be used to make predictions about design performance and support the creation of adaptive UIs. This paper presents Rico, the largest repository of mobile app designs to date, created to support five classes of data-driven applications: design search, UI layout generation, UI code generation, user interaction modeling, and user perception prediction. To create Rico, we built a system that combines crowdsourcing and automation to scalably mine design and interaction data from Android apps at runtime. The Rico dataset contains design data from more than 9.7k Android apps spanning 27 categories. It exposes visual, textual, structural, and interactive design properties of more than 72k unique UI screens. To demonstrate the kinds of applications that Rico enables, we present results from training an autoencoder for UI layout similarity, which supports query-by-example search over UIs. Identifying Fashion Accounts in Social Networks Doris Jung-Lin Lee, Jinda Han, Dana Chambourova, and Ranjitha Kumar KDD Workshop on ML Meets Fashion '17 Fashion and style are characterized by the ebb and flow of trends. With the rise of social media, fashion blogs, and the fast-fashion movement, bottom-up fashion trends are emerging at an ever-increasing rate. Recognizing these trends as they happen --- and the influencers that create them --- is challenging for retailers and consumers alike. As a first step, this paper presents a classifier for identifying fashion-related accounts on social media. To develop this classifier, we created a dataset of 10k Twitter accounts from crawling the set of users followed by ten prominent fashion accounts, and crowdsourced ground-truth labels for them. Based on this training data and a set of content-based features, we trained a classifier that identfies whether or not a Twitter account is fashion-related. In the future, we hope to leverage this classifier to identify key fashion influencers and conduct large-scale monitoring of fashion trends. An Experimentation Engine for Data-Driven Fashion Systems Ranjitha Kumar and Kristen Vaccaro Proceedings of AAAI Symposium on UX of ML '17 Data-driven fashion systems of the future will revolutionize the way consumers shop for clothing and choose outfits: imagine an automated personal stylist that ships clothes straight to your door based on their compatibility with your existing wardrobe, the upcoming events on your calendar, and style trends learned from the web. To build such systems, we must identify the fashion activities that are the largest consumer pain points, the interventions necessary to alleviate those pains, and the computational models that enable those interventions. To guide the design of these next-generation tools, we propose an experimentation engine for fashion interfaces: leveraging social media platforms to run multivariate design tests with thousands to millions of users. Social platforms are already home to dedicated communities of fashion enthusiasts, and expose programmable agents --- chatbots --- that can be used to rapidly prototype data-driven design interfaces. Measuring the number of followers and user engagement amongst these prototypes can inform the design of future standalone fashion systems. At this workshop, we will sketch the design space of fashion experiments, and present preliminary results from deploying our fashion bots. ERICA: Interaction Mining For Mobile Apps Biplab Deka, Zifeng Huang, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '16 Design plays an important role in adoption of apps. App design, however, is a complex process with multiple design activities. To enable data-driven app design applications, we present interaction mining --- capturing both static (UI layouts, visual details) and dynamic (user flows, motion details) components of an app's design. We present ERICA, a system that takes a scalable, human-computer approach to interaction mining existing Android apps without the need to modify them in any way. As users interact with apps through ERICA, it detects UI changes, seamlessly records multiple data-streams in the background, and unifies them into a user interaction trace. Using ERICA we collected interaction traces from over a thousand popular Android apps. Leveraging this trace data, we built machine learning classifiers to detect elements and layouts indicative of 23 common user flows. User flows are an important component of UX design and consists of a sequence of UI states that represent semantically meaningful tasks such as searching or composing. With these classifiers, we identified and indexed more than 3000 flow examples, and released the largest online search engine of user flows in Android apps. The Elements of Fashion Style Kristen Vaccaro, Sunaya Shivakumar, Ziqiao Ding, Karrie Karahalios, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '16 The outfits people wear contain latent fashion concepts capturing styles, seasons, events, and environments. Fashion theorists have proposed that these concepts are shaped by design elements such as color, material, and silhouette. A dress may be bohemian because of its pattern, material, trim, or some combination of them: it is not always clear how low-level elements translate to high-level styles. In this paper, we use polylingual topic modeling to learn latent fashion concepts jointly in two languages capturing these elements and styles. Using this latent topic formation we can translate between these two languages through topic space, exposing the elements of fashion style. We train the polylingual topic model (PLTM) on a set of more than half a million outfits collected from Polyvore, a popular fashion-based social network. We present novel, data-driven fashion applications that allow users to express their needs in natural language just as they would to a real stylist and produce tailored item recommendations for these style needs. Learning Interpretable Musical Compositional Rules and Traces Haizi Yu, Lav R. Varshney, Guy E. Garnett, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of ICML WHI '16 Throughout music history, theorists have identified and documented interpretable rules that capture the decisions of composers. This paper asks, Can a machine behave like a music theorist? It presents MUS-ROVER, a self-learning system for automatically discovering rules from symbolic music. MUS-ROVER performs feature learning via n-gram models to extract compositional rules --- statistical patterns over the resulting features. We evaluate MUS-ROVER on Bachs (SATB) chorales, demonstrating that it can recover known rules, as well as identify new, characteristic patterns for further study. We discuss how the extracted rules can be used in both machine and human composition. Accounting for Taste: Ranking Curators and Content in Social Networks Haizi Yu, Biplab Deka, Jerry O. Talton, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of CHI '16 Ranking users in social networks is a well-studied problem, typically solved by algorithms that leverage network structure to identify influential users and recommend people to follow. In the last decade, however, curation --- users sharing and promoting content in a network --- has become a central social activity, as platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and GitHub drive growth and engagement by connecting users through content and content to users. While existing algorithms reward users that are highly active with higher rankings, they fail to account for users' curatorial taste. This paper introduces CuRank, an algorithm for ranking users and content in social networks by explicitly modeling three characteristics of a good curator: discerning taste, high activity, and timeliness. We evaluate CuRank on datasets from two popular social networks --- GitHub and Vine --- and demonstrate its efficacy at ranking content and identifying good curators. What Makes a Brand Look Expensive? Jingxian Zhang, Neel Kothari, Asad Butt, and Ranjitha Kumar Extended Abstracts of CHI '16 Branding is a powerful tool that companies use to control the perception of their products' quality and price. A company's website is a digital vehicle for conveying this brand information. The look and feel of a website often influence a customer's impression of a brand's price category. To understand what makes a brand look expensive, we evaluate the website designs of two industries --- watches and cars. We ran a crowdsourced study to collect ratings of perceived cost based on web page screenshots. By training a random forest regression model over these ratings, we learned which visual features of website design are predictive of perceived cost. Webzeitgeist: Design Mining the Web Ranjitha Kumar, Arvind Satyanarayan, Cesar Torres, Maxine Lim, Salman Ahmad, Scott R. Klemmer, and Jerry O. Talton Proceedings of CHI '13 BEST PAPER AWARD Advances in data mining and knowledge discovery have transformed the way Web sites are designed. However, while visual presentation is an intrinsic part of the Web, traditional data mining techniques ignore render-time page structures and their attributes. This paper introduces design mining for the Web: using knowledge discovery techniques to understand design demographics, automate design curation, and support data-driven design tools. This idea is manifest in Webzeitgeist, a platform for large-scale design mining comprising a repository of over 100,000 Web pages and 100 million design elements. This paper describes the principles driving design mining, the implementation of the Webzeitgeist architecture, and the new class of data-driven design applications it enables. Learning Structural Semantics for the Web Maxine Lim, Ranjitha Kumar, Arvind Satyanarayan, Cesar Torres, Jerry O. Talton, and Scott R. Klemmer Stanford University CSTR 2012-03 Researchers have long envisioned a Semantic Web, where unstructured Web content is replaced by documents with rich semantic annotations. Unfortunately, this vision has been hampered by the difficulty of acquiring semantic metadata for Web pages. This paper introduces a method for automatically 'semantifying' structural page elements: using machine learning to train classifiers that can be applied in a post-hoc fashion. We focus on one popular class of semantic identifiers: those concerned with the structureor information architectureof a page. To determine the set of structural semantics to learn and to collect training data for the learning, we gather a large corpus of labeled page elements from a set of online workers. We discuss the results from this collection and demonstrate that our classifiers learn structural semantics in a general way. Learning Design Patterns with Bayesian Grammar Induction Jerry O. Talton, Lingfeng Yang, Ranjitha Kumar, Maxine Lim, Noah D. Goodman, and Radomr Mch Proceedings of UIST '12 BEST PAPER NOMINEE Design patterns have proven useful in many creative fields, providing content creators with archetypal, reusable guidelines to leverage in projects. Creating such patterns, however, is a time-consuming, manual process, typically relegated to a few experts in any given domain. In this paper, we describe an algorithmic method for learning design patterns directly from data using techniques from natural language processing and structured concept learning. Given a set of labeled, hierarchical designs as input, we induce a probabilistic formal grammar over these exemplars. Once learned, this grammar encodes a set of generative rules for the class of designs, which can be sampled to synthesize novel artifacts. We demonstrate the method on geometric models and Web pages, and discuss how the learned patterns can drive new interaction mechanisms for content creators. Data-Driven Web Design Ranjitha Kumar, Jerry O. Talton, Salman Ahmad, and Scott R. Klemmer Proceedings of ICML '12 INVITED APPLICATIONS PAPER This short paper summarizes challenges and opportunities of applying machine learning methods to Web design problems, and describes how structured prediction, deep learning, and probabilistic program induction can enable useful interactions for designers. We intend for these techniques to foster new work in data-driven Web design. Flexible Tree Matching Ranjitha Kumar, Jerry O. Talton, Salman Ahmad, Tim Roughgarden, and Scott R. Klemmer Proceedings of IJCAI '11 INVITED PAPER Tree-matching problems arise in many computational domains. The literature provides several methods for creating correspondences between labeled trees; however, by definition, tree-matching algorithms rigidly preserve ancestry. That is, once two nodes have been placed in correspondence, their descendants must be matched as well. We introduce flexible tree matching, which relaxes this rigid requirement in favor of a tunable formulation in which the role of hierarchy can be controlled. We show that flexible tree matching is strongly NP-complete, give a stochastic approximation algorithm for the problem, and demonstrate how structured prediction techniques can learn the algorithm's parameters from a set of example matchings. Finally, we present results from applying the method to tasks in Web design. Bricolage: Example-Based Retargeting for Web Design Ranjitha Kumar, Jerry O. Talton, Salman Ahmad, and Scott R. Klemmer Proceedings of CHI '11 BEST PAPER AWARD The Web provides a corpus of design examples unparalleled in human history. However, leveraging existing designs to produce new pages is often difficult. This paper introduces the Bricolage algorithm for transferring design and content between Web pages. Bricolage employs a novel, structured-prediction technique that learns to create coherent mappings between pages by training on human-generated exemplars. The produced mappings are then used to automatically transfer the content from one page into the style and layout of another. We show that Bricolage can learn to accurately reproduce human page mappings, and that it provides a general, efficient, and automatic technique for retargeting content between a variety of real Web pages. Designing with Interactive Example Galleries Brian Lee, Savil Srivastava, Ranjitha Kumar, Ronen Brafman, and Scott R Klemmer Proceedings of CHI '10 Designers often use examples for inspiration; examples offer contextualized instances of how form and content integrate. Can interactive example galleries bring this practice to everyday users doing design work, and does working with examples help the designs they create? This paper explores whether people can realize significant value from explicit mechanisms for designing by example modification. We present the results of three studies, finding that independent raters prefer designs created with the aid of examples, that users prefer adaptively selected examples to random ones, and that users make use of multiple examples when creating new designs. To enable these studies and demonstrate how software tools can facilitate designing with examples, we introduce interface techniques for browsing and borrowing from a corpus of examples, manifest in the Adaptive Ideas Web design tool. Adaptive Ideas leverages a faceted metadata interface for viewing and navigating example galleries.

 Toggle navigation Secure Learning Lab Publications Projects People Teaching Blog Github Bo Li Assistant Professor University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Email : lbo at illinois dot edu or lxbosky at gmail dot com I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . My research focuses on machine learning, security, privacy, and game theory. Specifically, much of our work aims at exploring vulnerabilities of machine learning systems to various adversarial attacks, and endeavors to develop real-world robust learning systems. The long-term goal for our group, Secure learning lab (SL 2 ), is to make machine learning algorithms safer, more efficient, and more explainable. We have worked on exploring different types of adversarial attacks including evasion and poisoning attacks in physical world with semantically meaningful constraints. We have developed and will continue to explore robust learning algorithms based on game theory, prior knowledge of data distribution, as well as properties of learning tasks. Our work directly benefits applications such as computer vision, question-answering, audio recognition, and privacy preserving medical records analysis. I'm looking for motivated postdocs who are experienced in theoretic research, including learning theory or information theory. Please directly sent me an email if you are interested.

 Illinois Grainger Engineering Rakesh Nagi Select a page to view: Go Highlights Biography Research Information Fusion Social Networks Congestion in Facilities Location and Layout Facility Layout Agile Manufacturing Realtime Visualization Sensor Networks Facilities Design and Cellular Manufacturing Operations of Production Systems Variant Design and Data Mining Honors Teaching Search the site: Search Highlights Technical Highlights Google Scholar Link I. Facilities Design Cellular Manufacturing: I proposed a new material handling based formulation for manufacturing cell formation in 1990. It departed from the then prevalent matrix or similarity coefficient-based methods. The paper received very large citations (322 in Google Scholar) and impacted future research in cellular manufacturing for the next two decades. Additional papers are IJPR 1990b, 1994; Annals of OR 1996. Location Theoretic Approaches to Facility Layout: This is a highly innovative alternative to the traditional space discretization and quadratic assignment approach to facility layout. Simultaneously, location theory is advanced to consider finite-sized new facilities. Along with a co-PI, two NSF awards were granted in this area, and high impact papers were published (about 18 in total, including OR, 2018 (in R4), 2002; Mg. Sc. 2009; IIE Trans 2011, 2005, 2003; EJOR 2009, 2007, 2007; NRL 2005; C&OR). Hybrid/Integrated Facility Design: Most facility redesign situations do not lend themselves to pure cellular structures. Aisle design, Input/Output point selection, and Material Handling System design are intertwined problems. A notable highlight that integrates layout and aisle design under congestion is: Zhang, M., Batta, R. and Nagi, R., Designing Manufacturing Facility Layouts to Mitigate Congestion, IIE Transactions on Design and Manufacturing, 2011, Vol. 43(10), pp. 689-702. [IIE Transactions Best paper award from journal issues from July 2011 through June 2012.] II. Operation of Production Systems Introduced a new concept of Just-In-Time Production of Large Assemblies: While the academic literature is rich in scheduling theory, the scheduling of large multi-level assemblies has not attracted much attention. This problem is very relevant in practice and most companies use MRP (Materials Requirement Planning) systems to plan/schedule orders. Since the ground-breaking publication in IIE Transactions in 1996, I have been working on incorporating many realistic issues like lot-sizing and material handling, in this framework. This problem is of significant industrial impact (even though the solution methods are often heuristics). For instance: (i) Contrary to popular belief, we have shown that lot-for-lot production in small batches may not always be the best JIT strategy. Even when the set-up times are as small as double the unit operation processing times, a judicious lot merging may achieve the goals of JIT better. (ii) In an empirical study integrated schedules provided improved makespans over sequential scheduling of work-center and then the material-handling transporters in 93% of the cases. Newer papers included formal Lagrangian optimization methods IEEE-TASE 2013; IJPR 2013. Integrated Production Logistics and Supply Chain Design. I have worked with two doctoral students in integrated production and distribution systems and supply chain design problems. I published a survey paper in IIE Transactions in 1999 (441 citations in Google Scholar) and contributed to supply chain design in response to a new market opportunity (3 papers; 2 [ScienceDirects Top 25 Hottest Articles.]). The paper on Economics of Managerial Neglect in Supply Chain Delivery Performance in the Engineering Economist received much publicity through various news releases (incl. New York Times and Washington Post). III. Agile Manufacturing NSF CAREER award 1996: Developed a workflow-based information system paradigm to keep engineering information consistent in an agile/distributed partner manufacturing environment: Software prototype Virtual Information System for Agile Manufacturing Enterprises VISAME. IGES to STEP AP202 design translation research resulted in commercial implementation in STEPTools software http://www.steptools.com (leading STEP solutions provider). (211 and 77 citations.) Educational impact: Developed one of its kind Graduate Course in Agile Manufacturing integrating research results from CAREER award (presented in ASEE). Data Mining in Engineering Design: Novel application of data mining research in the domain of Engineering Design. Developed new unordered tree mining approach suitable for clustering Bills-Of-Materials. This can aid in search for similar products or parts or help develop product configurators. C&OR 2006; IEEE SMC 2005; ASME JCISE 2004. Mass Customization of Assemblies (Variant Design): This work (published as a two-part paper in IIE Transactions) has the potential to impact mass-customization of assembled products (e.g., automobiles). The approach is based on feature-level mating graph to capture assembly constraints and on hierarchical object models to capture compositional relationships, searching similar parts, and finally modifying them cost effectively to proliferate mass-customized variants. IV. Sensor Networks, Military Applications, and Social Networks A new method for clustering sensors in wireless ad hoc networks operating in a threat environment was published in OR 2005. Cross pollination with location theoretic methods for a new Dynamic Max Expected Covering Location Problem was invented. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Routing under threat, or joint routing and sensor selection; I have received as co-PI and PI two ONR awards on this topic. OR 2017; C&OR 2012; J Sim 2014; IEEE-TASE 2018. High-Level Information Fusion through graph theoretic models/algorithms is an area of recent interest. I have received funding from IARPA and many DoD agencies on these topics. I led as PI an Army Research Office MURI project ($6.25M) on Hard-Soft Information Fusion and another IARPA/AFRL project on Knowledge Discovery ($500k/yr). New algorithms for influence maximization in social networks. New parallel cascade model and optimal seed selection and scheduling (OMEGA 2018, 2016; IEEE CSS 2016).

He was the Editor-in-Chief of SpringerVerlags Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing and is currently a member of the editorial board of the Communications of the ACM, the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, and the International Journal of Parallel Programming. He has devoted much of his career to the study of languages, tools, and compilers for parallel computing. His PhD dissertation was one of the first studies on compiler techniques for multiprocessors. He has continued this work contributing with techniques for program analysis and program transformation as well as methodologies to evaluate the effectiveness of compilers. He pioneered the study of race detection techniques for shared-memory program. Padua has worked on autotuning, high level notations for parallel programming, compiler evaluation, and the efficient implementation of scripting languages. In the area of autotuning, he has worked on the development of compiler strategies, advanced notations, accurate performance models, and machine learningbased search techniques. He led the development of the hierarchically tiled arrays notation whose goal is to facilitate the representation of parallelism and locality. His research group collaborated with IBM compiler writers in an influential evaluation of the effectiveness of vectorization. In the area of scripting languages, his research group developed techniques to improve the performance of MATLAB and R programs. Padua has supervised the dissertations of 30 PhD students.

 Madhusudan Parthasarathy Research Interests Software verification; Security; Program Synthesis and Machine Learning; Logic and automata theory; Outreach Interests ConTraIL project : Privacy-preserving contact tracing project. See Whitepaper . Current research projects and philosophy My general research philosophy is to turn the theory lens (mainly logic and algorithms) towards practical computing domains. I shy away, for the most part, from working on problems purely motivated by theoretical concerns as well as those entirely based on heuristics to solve practical problems. My current research interests are primarily in automating software verification , building correct-by-design secure distributed systems , and exploring synergies between machine learning and program synthesis for building intelligent systems. Automating software verification: Proving a program safe using logical techniques is composed of two phases: finding possible inductive invariants and formally establishing that they are inductive invariants that prove safety. For the latter problem, the main approach that I currently believe in for automation is the framework of natural proofs that we have been working on for the last 10 years. In particular, though I believe decidable logics are useful for this problem, I do not believe they will solely be powerful enough for addressing the needs of program verification, due to their inherent inexpressivity. Natural proofs aim for sound and oftentimes complete (though not decidable) approaches for this problem. As for the former problem for finding invariants, I believe that a combination of several techniques that are proposed in recent literature (including interpolation and IC3) are called for. The primary techniques techniques I work on have been those based on learning and (more recently) finding uninterpreted invariants . Building verified systems: My view on building verified systems is that they should be built correct by construction (as opposed to verifying existing systems), by proving more abstract systems correct and then refining them to concrete performant code. The proofs of abstract systems against complex specifications would invariably require considerable human input and intuition, while automation can help in refining abstract systems to performant code. Machine Learning and Program Synthesis: One of my latest interests is in building synergies of program synthesis and machine learning --- I believe practical pattern-matching inductive techniques (like neural nets) can be combined with symbolic search (like synthesizing logical formulas and programs) to build more intelligent systems. Note to prospective students I am actively looking for Ph.D. students in the following areas. If you are interested, please apply for the Ph.D. program and write to me personally. Machine learning and program synthesis; learning logics. Exploring new techniques that go beyond neural nets by using symbolic search, abstraction, and reasoning. Building verified software using almost-automated verification, especially distributed systems that involve crptography, like blockchains, bitcoin, and smart contracts. Logics and reasoning for program verification: especially logics involving expressive specifications for programs manipulating quantified specifications and datastructures. See papers on natural proofs in POPL 2012, PLDI 2013, PLDI 2014, and POPL 2018, and the Dryad and VCDryad ) pages. Invariant synthesis and mining specifications from code using machine learning, online learning, and learning logical formulas. See papers in CAV14, POPL16, TACAS16, TOCL18, TACAS18, OOPSLA18. Exploring the world of uninterpreted programs--- we have discovered a new technique for verifying uninterpreted programs using complete/decidable techniques for generating inductive invariants. This opens up a wide avenue for future work--- tracttable verification, invariant synthesis, synergy with natural proofs, and program synthesis.

Currently, I am focusing on fault tolerant consensus (aka blockchain), proofs of space/time/bandwidth, and homomorphic encryption. My past work includes oblivious RAM and secure hardware.

 Gene E Robinson Gene E Robinson Department Affiliate (217) 265-0309 generobi@illinois.edu 320 Morrill Hall Biography Other/Principal Activities My research group uses the Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, to understand the mechanisms governing social behavior. Behavioral development occurs in many animals, including humans. As animals age and pass through different life stages, their genetically determined behavioral responses to environmental and social stimuli change in predictable ways. Often these responses increase in complexity and involve learning. Our research is designed to explain the function and evolution of behavioral mechanisms that integrate the activity of individuals in a society, neural and neuroendocrine mechanisms that regulate behavior within the brain of the individual, and the genes that influence social behavior.

 About Recent Research People Acknowledgements Teaching Publications Alexander Schwing Assistant Professor Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Computer Science Coordinated Science Laboratory University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Office: CSL 103 eMail: @alexschwing Short Bio Alex's research is centered around machine learning and computer vision. He is particularly interested in algorithms for prediction with and learning of non-linear (deep nets), multivariate and structured distributions, and their application in numerous tasks, e.g., for 3D scene understanding from a single image. Alex Schwing is an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign and affiliated with the Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Computer Science Department . Prior to that he was a postdoctoral fellow in the Machine Learning Group at University of Toronto collaborating with Raquel Urtasun , Rich Zemel and Ruslan Salakhutdinov . He completed his PhD in computer science in the Computer Vision and Geometry Group at ETH Zurich working with Marc Pollefeys , Tamir Hazan and Raquel Urtasun , and graduated from Technical University of Munich (TUM) with a diploma in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology . Recent Research (in layman's terms) Here are some of the recent research projects that I was working on with an amazing set of students. We conduct reproducible and open research and release code whenever possible. Amodal Video Object Segmentation We want to understand objects in their entirety despite occlusions. Check out our new dataset. More... Amodal Video Object Segmentation Delineating (i.e., segmenting) objects as a whole (i.e., amodal segmentation) is a challenging task. How can we see the unseen, i.e., how can we segment occluded parts? We think this is only possible if algorithms understand objects as a whole rather than algorithms assessing whether a pixel belongs to an object. Moreover, we think temporal information, i.e., understanding how objects move, is important. However, there was no dataset which delineates objects as a whole for every frame of a video. To facilitate this we collected the 'semantic a-modal instance level video object segmentation' (SAILVOS) dataset. We hope this dataset will enable new research in the direction of amodal instance-level segmentation. Please feel free to reach out with questions and suggestions. Check out our website for more. Stable Generative Modeling We develop and study generative modeling techniques and their stability. More... Stable Generative Modeling Training generative adversarial nets (GANs) used to be challenging. In a sequence of papers we studied the reasons. Specifically, in 'Dualing GANs' we used the mathematical concept of duality to reformulate the original GAN min-max objective (saddle point) into a minimization. This yielded exciting relations between GANs and moment matching but wasn't easy to scale. Subsequently, we showed in 'Sliced Wasserstein GAN' that duality (Kantorovich-Rubinstein) can be removed from the Wasserstein GAN objective by using projections onto many one-dimensional spaces. To reduce the number of one-dimensional spaces we subsequently introduced the 'Max-Sliced Distance' which we found to be very easy to train. In our research on image inpainting we found back-propagation through GANs to the latent space to be challenging . We studied the reasons in our work on 'annealed importance sampling with Hamilton Monte Carlo for GANs' . Check out some of our code for more: Sliced Wasserstein GAN , Backpropagation Collaborative Embodied Agents We develop algorithms that enable multiple agents to collaborate in visual environments. More... Collaborative Embodied Agents In collaboration with AI2 we develop algorithms and environments for collaborative and visual multi-agent reinforcement learning. It seems implausible to develop a single agent which can address all tasks on its own. Adressing tasks in collaboration seems much more feasible. Yet understanding collaborative visual reinforcement learning with communication is at its infancy. We are interested in changing this. In our recent 'Two Body Problem' work we showed that communicative agents can solve a challenging task much faster. Learning to Anticipate We develop algorithms to better anticipate what may happen in a scene a few seconds from the given observation. More... Learning to Anticipate We recently started to develop algorithms which can anticipate what the current observation will look like a few seconds from now. Following the vision of neuroscientist Kenneth Craik we agree that 'a creature must anticipate the outcome of a movement to navigate safely' (1943). In a first project on 'Diverse Generation for multi-agent sports games' we looked at team-sports data and showed how to anticipate future movement of players and how to answer counterfactual questions related to what would have happened if the ball trajectory was modified. In subsequent work on 'Chirality Nets' we studied human pose forecasting with structured representations. Check out our website for more. Structured Prediction We devise novel algorithms and models which learn and exploit correlations when jointly predicting multiple variables. More... Structured Prediction Structured prediction is an area that I have worked on for many years, already during my PhD and PostDoc. For instance, jointly with my advisors and collaborators we developed deep structured models , algorithms for globally convergent maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference , asynchronous MAP inference , and distributed MAP inference . We continue to develop more efficient algorithms for inference in structured models and more expressive models. For example, in recent work we introduced 'NLStruct' which is able to capture non-linear correlations. A shortcoming of 'NLStruct' is its saddlepoint objective which makes it challenging to optimize. Therefore, more recently we developed 'GSPEN' which is more expressive and easier to optimize. Check out our code for more. Supervised & Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation We develop fast supervised and unsupervised video object segmentation methods. More... Supervised & Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation We are interested in developing algorithms for weakly-supervised and unsupervised video object segmentation. Given segmentation annotations for the first frame, classical methods require an expensive finetuning step. This limits scalability of those methods. We address this concern in 'VideoMatch' . Specifically, instead of a classification problem we propose to formulate the task of instance level video segmentation as a matching. Consequently, finetuning is no longer require to obtain good results. In addition, in our 'MaskRNN' work we exploit temporal correlations for accurate instance level video object segmentation. We also study unsupervised video object segmentation . Diversity in Vision-Language Models We think there is no single best description. How can we adequately capture and model ambiguity in vision-language models? More... Diversity in Vision-Language Models Describing an image is an important task. Classical methods only provide a single description for an image. We argue that this does not live up the standard: we want to provide many equally suitable descriptions. In other words, we aim to better capture the ambiguity in vision-language tasks. In this direction we first looked at 'Creativity' using generative models (variational auto-encoders). To include controlability we then extended this to conditional models and also studied its ability to form a meaningful dialog . We later found in 'ConvCap' that convolutional models are not as overly confident as classical long-short-term-memory based techniques, which helps to better capture ambiguity. Moreover, convolutional models can be conditional as well . More recently, we studied how language models can anticipate/forecast how a sentence will be completed by using more fine-grained latent spaces . We found this technique to significantly boost the ability to better capture ambiguity. We also study diversity aspects for visual question answering via attention models and factual visual question answering. For the latter we developed techniques to include information from knowledge basis either directly into prediction or via graph neural nets . We also developed optimization techniques for supervised visual grounding and its unsupervised counterpart . Check out some of our code for more: Convolutional Captioning Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning We develop algorithms for efficient practical multi-agent reinforcement learning. More... Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning We are interested in developing efficient practical multi-agent reinforecement learning algorithms. Classical techniques use a critic which has to learn from data that an environment should be assessed identically if the agents are permuted. This makes multi-agent reinforcement learning even more sample inefficient. To address this concern we recently introduced the permutation invariant critic (PIC) . As the name suggests, PIC guarantees that an environment is assessed identically, irrespective of the agent permutation. We found this to significantly improve scalability. Check out our code to train systems with up to 200 agents: Permutation Invariant Critics People This research wouldn't be possible without an amazing set of team members and collaborators.

On January 15, 2009, U.S. Airways Flight 1549 left LaGuardia Airport in New York City en route to Seattle via Charlotte. Shortly after takeoff, the plane hit birds and lost two engines. Faced with few options, the captain, Chesley Sully Sullenberger, took elusive action and landed the plane in the Hudson River, saving the lives of the 155 people on board. While Sullenbergers experience a fighter pilot and training officer with the United States Air Force and 30 years as a commercial airline pilot no doubt was a factor in his quick decision making, not all passengers are lucky enough to have that experience guiding their flights. Through a National Science Foundation grant, ateam of researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigns Grainger College of Engineering and the Georgia Institute of Technology are working on an advanced autopilot, which will autonomously evaluate unforeseen circumstances, take the best course of action, and land the plane safely. Positions Available : One Postdoc and one PhD Biography : Lui Sha graduated with Phd. from CMU in 1985. He worked at the Software Engineering Institute from 1986 to 1998. He joined UIUC in 1998. Currently, he is Donald B. Gillies Chair Professor of Computer Science, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He was named Tau Beta Pi Daniel C. Drucker Eminent Faculty in 2017. He is a Fellow of ACM and IEEE and a recipient of IEEEs Simon Ramo medal, which honors exceptional achievement in systems engineering and systems science. IEEE Medals are the highest distinctions that the IEEE presents. Sha has led the creation of acomprehensive system engineering approach to design and build complex real-time systems, advancing the field from one using hand-crafted, trial-by-error processes into one that is a scientific engineering discipline. The approach, called Generalized Rate Monotonic Scheduling (GRMS) theory, developed with John Lehoczky and Raj Rajkumar, provides predictability, efficiency, and flexibility for scheduling complex concurrent real-time tasks. GRMS has become the best practice of the real-time computing industry, and is regularly taught in real time computing classes. Shas IEEE Fellow citation states, for technical leadership and research contributions which enabled the transformation of real-time computing practice from an ad hoc process to an engineering process based on analytic methods. From 2015-2017, Sha was appointed by Administrator of NASA, Charles Bolden, to the Aeronautics Committee of the NASA Advisory Council. He was selected for this council based largely his contribution to real-time computing and to complexity reduction and control architectures. The Simplex architecture allows the safe use of difficult or unverifiable complex control software. Its principles have been successfully used to improve the stability advanced avionics systems. Sha and his team invented the Physically Asynchronous Logically Synchronous (PALS) architecture. Steven P. Miller of Rockwell Collins Inc. demonstrated that, using PALS architecture, the model checking time of a dual redundant flight control system dropped from over 35 hours to less than 30 seconds. Sha and Millers team received the 2009 David Lubkowski Award for the Advancement of Digital Avionics from American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Examples of Research Impacts He is a widely cited author in real-time and embedded computing community. His work contributions to the development high technology systems include: Global Positioning Satellite : Contributions to the worldwide navigation. The navigation payload software for the next block of Global Positioning System upgrade recently completed testing. This design would have been difficult or impossible prior to the development of rate monotonic theory, L. Doyle, and J. Elzey Successful Use of Rate Monotonic Theory on A Formidable Real-Time System , technical report, p.1, ITT, Aerospace Communication Division, 1993. International Space Station : Through the development of Rate Monotonic Scheduling, we now have a system that will allow [Space Station]Fr eedoms computers to budget their time, to choose between a variety of tasks, and decide not only which one to do first but how mu ch time to spend i n the process , Aaron Cohen, Deputy Administrator of NASA, October 1992 (p. 3), Charting The Future: Challenges and Promises Ahead of Space Exploration. Mars Pathfinder : When was the last time you saw a room of people cheer a group of computer science theorists for their significant practical contribution to advancing human knowledge? It was quite a moment. For the record, the paper was L. Sha, R. Rajkumar, and J. P. Lehoczky. Priority Inheritance Protocols: An Approach to Real-Time Synchronization. In IEEE Transactions on Computers, vol. 39, pp. 1175-1185, Sep. 1990 . reported by Dr. Michael Jones in http:// catless . ncl .ac. uk /Risks/ 19.49.html Over the course of his career, he has also served as a member of the National Academy of Sciences committee on Certifiably Dependable Software, the peer review panel of Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch at NASAs Langley Research Center, and the NSFs Planning Committee on Cyber Physical Systems on high assurance medical devices. Publications Education Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students, UIUC, 1999 and 2000 GE Scholar, the Academy for Excellence in Engineering Education, UIUC, 1999. For young researchers: Elements of Successful Research and How to Write Research Papers Current Projects Real Time Multicore Computing Single Core Equivalence : Each core in a multicore chip can be used and certified as if it were a single core chip, allowing Virtual Single Core : A set of cores of a multicore chip can be used as if it were a large single core chip. The recent research focus on modern high performance CPU-GPU real-time computing architecture. Real-time Virtual Synchrony: A networked avionic system can be programed as if it were a perfectly synchronized system under the Physically asynchronous Logically Synchronous (PALS) protocol.For dual redundant flight control system, the verification time without PALS is over 35 hours. Using PALS, the verification time dropped to less than 30 seconds, winning the David Lubkowski award for the Advancement of Digital Avionics from American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Medical Best Practice Guidance (GPS) Systems In 1999, the challenge of preventable medical errors was first raised in a landmark study by the American Medical Association: To Err is Human . This study reported that at least 44,000 people, and perhaps as many as 98,000 people, die in hospitals each year as a result of medical errors that could have been prevented . In 2013 Journal of Patient Safety reported that more than 400,000 people die every year because of preventable medical errors. The negative economic impact was estimated at a colossal $1 trillion per year in a US Senate hearing in 2014 . Preventable medical errors are not a medical knowledge problem. It is a medical cyber-physical system challenge in the form of medical information and workflow management challenge, where the medical devices, doctors, nurses, and technicians have to work together flawlessly in real-time. Like how GPS revolutionized navigation, Medical Best Practice System will revolutionize clinical practices. Currently, we are working with Carle Foundation Foundation Hospital and with OSF Illinois Childrens Hospital in the research and development of medical best practice systems. The Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Guidance System has entered Phase II evaluation at Carle ICU. We also completed the initial prototypes of Sepsis Guidance System. Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Guidance System Review Medical staff with the assistance of the guidance systems will achieve: More rapid and accurate identification of critical changes of patient conditions, More rapid and consistent entry of vital information Fit into current clinical workflow, Stricter adherence to up-to-date standardized medical treatment guidelines and protocols, Improved team effectiveness, and Reduced medical errors from an altered sense of time and memory lapses ( due to high stress ). Carle Foundation Hospital: Karen White, M.D., Vasantha Reddi, Ph.D. Pediatric Sepsis Guidance System Prototype Review Computerized Guidance System will: Assist clinicians with early detection of pediatric sepsis by providing real-time assistance with clinical management of pediatric sepsis Facilitate continued assessment of septic children while providing feedback on next steps in management and Improve adherence to accepted practice standards for management of pediatric sepsis Early vascular access and timeliness of fluid administration Improved rates of antibiotic administration within 60 minutes of presentation Serve as resource to teach less experienced clinicians and clinicians-in-training important tenants of pediatric sepsis management Serve as a tool for simulation-based training and in situ training OSF Childrens Hospital of Illinois & JUMP: Richard Pearl, M.D., Jonathon Gehlbach, M.D. Positions Available Part-time jobs in the lab: software development and/or hardware device interfaces Recent Posts New Initiative: Engineering Next Generation Medical Systems Posted on April 1, 2013 by Admin We have started a new initiative towards safe and effective medical systems.

 Hari Sundaram University of Illinois About Me Research Publications Teaching Contact & Meet Me Hari Sundaram Hari Sundaram is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science and the Advertising Departments at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research, lies at the intersection of computer science and advertising and motivated by collective decision-making problems at scale: How do we spend less time stuck in traffic?; Live in cities with little or no pollution?; Not worry about infectious disease outbreaks? These questions require us to confront a fundamental tension: How do we reconcile an individuals desire for agency and choice in what they do, with what everyone wants for society as a whole? Dr. Sundaram, along with his students at the Crowd Dynamics Lab , is keen to understand the role that computing can play, including perils, in addressing this tension. His lab develops theoretical frameworks, designs algorithms, builds scalable systems and performs experiments in the wild to understand human behavior at scale, and to empower individuals to take better decisions. Their research has won awards from the ACM and IEEE societies.

In this proposal, we propose to work on two closely related problems: detection of emergent communities of people and their evolution in a large scale media rich network; identification of key roles for both people and media objects. 2007 Associate Editor of the Year award Annually, the Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications and Applications (TOMM) honors one member of the Editorial Board with the TOMM Associate Editor of the Year Award. The purpose of the award is the distinction of excellent work for ACM TOMM and hence also for the whole multimedia community in the previous year. Criteria for the award are (1) the amount of submissions processed in time, (2) the performance during the reviewing process and (3) the accurate interaction with the reviewers in order to broader the awareness for the journal. 2007 IBM faculty Award Develop novel context-aware event models, and event annotation algorithms with the goal of improving the search quality and annotation results in online social network communities. There are three main contributions: development of event models, and the attendant event algebras; development of representations of event and user context that are query dependent; algorithms that determine user-user correlation given a query, and determining effective recommendations by using the event neighborhood. 2007 Best Student Paper Award, JCDL Bageshree Shevade, Hari Sundaram and Lexing Xie, Modeling Personal and Social Network Context for Event Annotation in Images , Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2007, Jun. 2007, Vancouver, Canada. 2007 Best Student Paper Finalist, ACM Multimedia Yinpeng Chen, Weiwei Xu, Hari Sundaram, Thanassis Rikakis, and Sheng-Min Liu.

 Hello, Friend. My name is Matus Telgarsky . I am an assistant professor at UIUC . I received my PhD at UCSD in 2013 under Sanjoy Dasgupta . I study mathematical aspects of machine learning. Current interests. Approximation/representation power of deep networks. I proved there exist deep networks which can only be approximated by shallower networks if they have exponentially as many nodes ( arXiv , video , lecture notes one and two ), and continue to work on related questions (e.g., rational functions , and generative networks (with Bolton Bailey) ). Generalization of deep networks. The empirically-observed excess risk correlates with the Lipschitz constant of networks, and yields a generalization bound ( arXiv , poster , video ). Optimization and implicit regularization of deep networks. In grad school I studied AdaBoost, and found that taking the step size to 0 leads to margin maximization ( arXiv ). Ziwei Ji and I have been studying margin maximization for deep networks, first proving it for logistic regression ( arXiv ), and then for deep linear networks ( arXiv ). Other interests. In the past I focused on boosting and clus te ring ; in the future i hope to study reinforcement learning. Teaching. Deep learning theory (CS 598 DLT): fall 2020 , fall 2019. Machine learning theory (CS 598 TEL): fall 2018 , fall 2017, fall 2016. Machine learning (CS 446): spring 2019 , spring 2018. Miscellaneous. I have two glorious PhD students: Bolton Bailey , Ziwei Ji () . My research is funded by an NSF CAREER award , and an NVIDIA GPU grant. During summer 2019 I am co-organizing a Simons Institute summer program on deep learning ; I was also at the Simons Institute during Spring 2017 . I co-founded the Midwest ML Symposium (MMLS) and moreover co-chaired the 2017 and 2018 editions, all together with glorious Po-Ling Loh . I have a degree in violin performance from Juilliard , but hardly play any more . I coded a screensaver , a 3-d plotting tool , and a few other things if you know where to look. My desk is always messy . I like scifi books, pencils , ramen , and aphex twin .

Our paper Application-level hardware tracing for scaling post-silicon debug by Debjit Pal and Vasudevan was nominated for a best paper award at DAC 2018. This presents an approach to analyze SoC hardware for mobile devices using formal modeling of app-level information. The paper was the result of a long and productive collaboration with both Intel and IBM. The app-level analysis scaled up the silicon debug to a large, real life SoC as opposed to small benchmarks. We want everyone to use it, so we put it here . Google Faculty Research Award 2019 Shobha wins 2019 Google Faculty Research Award. The award is for the reliability of large scale distributed systems. More details can be found here and here . Invited talk at Facebook Virtual Reality Labs Talk on GoldMine and beyond: Scaling verification with machine learning. Great questions and discussions. Best paper nomination at ASP-DAC 2019 Our paper, A Figure of Merit for Assertions in Verification was one of the nominated papers for the best paper award at ASP-DAC 2019. The paper presents computable metrics to find the goodness of human written and machine-generated assertions. The paper attempts to answer the question of how good the specification of a system is. Assertion quality metrics can be used for design understanding, coverage analysis and debugging. The tool for assertion metrics is available for download here . Invited tutorial at VLSI Design 2019 Shobha gave an invited half day tutorial on DUPLEX , our optimization tool. The talk had new results from applying DUPLEX to computer vision and perception problems. DUPLEX works better than gradient descent in our preliminary results. Great audience- gave ideas for lots of new applications for DUPLEX! Women In STEM forum Prof Vasudevan was a panelist for a women in engineering forum to discuss increased participation of girls and women in STEM fields in India. The event saw a participation of more than 300 people. Encouraging. The panel was on women retaining their jobs, given the sharp drops observed mid-career. Machine learning applications book chapter by Shobha Machine learning and AI has made its way into manufacturing and electronic design automation in a big way. Watch out for Prof. Vasudevans new chapter in the book on ML4CAD by Springer , due to be published in Spring 2019. Thanks to editors Ibrahim Elfadel, Duane Boning and Xin Li for putting together a timely topic. New kind of error out to get us in our cars! We uncovered a new class of soft errors caused by electrostatic discharge. We fabricated a test chip and measured corruptions in apps and programs running on the chip when a physical ESD gun shoots at the chip. We find that these are particularly prevalent and widespread in automotive environments. The biggest threat from these errors is to microcontrollers in ESD rich zones like highly autonomous vehicles. An error in our cars could have serious consequences. Watch out for our forthcoming paper in DATE 2019, Guilty As Charged: Computational Reliability Threats Posed By Electrostatic Discharge-induced Soft Errors . Talk at Haifa Verification and Privacy Conference Prof. Vasudevan gave an invited talk at the Haifa ViPs conference, a new incarnation of the Haifa Verification Conference (HVC).

Woese Institute for Genomic Biology Affiliate, National Center for Supercomputing Applications Affiliate, Coordinated Sciences Laboratory Affiliate, Unit for Criticism and Literary Theory Affiliate, departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering; Bioengineering; Mathematics; Statistics; Evolution, Ecology, and Behavior; Entomology; and Plant Biology. Fellow of the ISCB (International Society for Computational Biology), 2017 Fellow of the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), 2015 PhD (Mathematics) University of California at Berkeley, 1991 B.S. (Mathematics) University of California at Berkeley, 1984 biosketch Wikipedia page Google Scholar page Statement of support I stand with the African-American community and all my friends and colleagues who are outraged by the killing of George Floyd and other African-American men and women. News: I contributed to a paper about 1 Billion Years of Green Plant Evolution , published in Nature by the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative. (PDF) I published a bibliometrics paper in Quantitative Science Studies , published by MIT press, in which we identify model misspecification as a problem for a prior publication published in Science. I am teaching CS 581 (Algorithmic Computational Genomics) in Fall 2020. See this page for information about applying to the NSF CAREER program. Research Overview : I am a computer scientist, data scientist, and perhaps even a statistician. I work on algorithmic problems in computational biology with the aim of developing methods that biologists will use and that will have transformative accuracy and scalability. Part of this work involves mathematics (to understand the theoretical guarantees of the methods I develop, and of other methods), but part of it is also empirical (to understand performance on data). So implementation and testing is very important. All of my methods are a combination of graph algorithms and machine learning or statistical learning. My work in machine learning in particular involves the development of novel ensemble methods, using phylogenetic estimation to guide the design of the ensemble. The machine learning I do is largely unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, largely because there is very limited reliable labeled data in my field; as a result, I do not work in deep learning. Mathematical proofs are part of what I do, but my focus on empirical performance (on data, in other words) drives my research. My current work is on large-scale and complex estimation problems in phylogenomics (genome-scale phylogeny estimation), multiple sequence alignment , metagenomics , and historical linguistics . I am a big fan of Blue Waters , and have benefitted from several allocations. I also very much like collaborating with biologists, and have worked with the Avian Phylogenomics Project and the Thousand Plant Transcriptome project, among others. I am seeking new grad students available: I have openings in my group for graduate students (PhD or MS) to work on developing computational methods for large-scale multiple sequence alignment, phylogeny estimation, metagenomics, and even historical linguistics. Strong programming skills, mathematical intuition, and interest in collaboration are necessary. If you are interested in working with me, you should take my graduate course CS 581: Algorithmic Genomic Biology which I will teach in Fall 2020. Interested in working with me? If you are a graduate student, please read this first and then contact me. If you are an undergraduate , please see this page . If you are looking for a postdoc position, see this . Postdoc positions at UIUC Computer Science . These are flexible postdocs that can be used with anyone in the CS department. If you want to teach, then these positions will be funded 50% by the department and 50% by the research faculty mentor. In exchange for departmental funding, these postdocs will teach 1 course per year, based on department needs and the candidate's interest; if the candidate wants to teach more, they will have the opportunity to do so. Computational Phylogenetics : An introduction to designing methods for phylogeny estimation , published by Cambridge University Press (and available for purchase at Amazon and as an E-book at Google Play ). Errata are posted as I find them. The image of the Monterey Cypress is there because of the NSF-funded CIPRES project , whose purpose was to develop the methods and computational infrastructure to improve large-scale phylogeny estimation. Why I wrote this book . I dedicated the book to my PhD advisor Gene Lawler , who died in 1994; see this memorium (published in the Journal of Computational Biology, 10 Jun 2009) that I co-authored with Dan Gusfield, David Shmoys, and Jan Karel Lenstra about Gene. Bioinformatics and Phylogenetics : Seminal Contributions of Bernard Moret , published by Springer. This book is a Festschrift for Bernard Moret , who retired from EPFL in December 2016. The book contains a collection of self-contained chapters that can be used for an advanced course in computational biology and bioinformatics. Current Funding : IIBR Informatics: Advancing Bioinformatics Methods using Ensembles of Profile Hidden Markov Models , funded by NSF grant 2006069, beginning August 15, 2020. This project (joint with Jian Peng) will extend the theory foundations of ensembles of profile HMMs, and use them for protein structure and function prediction. Multiple sequence alignment , funded by NSF grant ABI-1458652, beginning August 2015. This project will develop new methods for multiple sequence alignment, building on our SAT, PASTA, and UPP methods. Recent NSF funding has supported work in metagenomics , phylogenomics , and graph-theoretic algorithms . All of these are still very active research areas in my group. I also recently benefited from support of the John P. Simon Guggenheim Foundation , and earlier support from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation , the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University , the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University , and Microsoft Research, New England . The Founder Professorship is funded through the Grainger Engineering Breakthroughs Initiative , which is supporting development of research in Big Data and Bioengineering at UIUC. I am grateful to the National Science Foundation for its continuous support since 1994. See this page for completed projects funded by NSF, starting in 2001.

In healthcare, that means patient outcomes (e.g., patient safety, quality of care) as well as clinician outcomes (e.g., workload, burnout). She has conducted research focused on primary care, care coordination of patients with chronic conditions (hospital to community care transitions) and trauma care. Her dissertation, conducted in the context of a larger project developing health information technology to support teamwork and care transitions, took a macroergonomic approach to studying care transitions of trauma patients. She then examined on the handoff communication associated with those handoffs as instances of team cognition. Current projects include continuing to study care transitions; she plans to conduct observation studies of inpatient care transitions between hospital units as well as return to the community care setting by studying hospital discharge care transitions. Part of this work will explore the concept of the patient journey, i.e., spatio-temporal distribution of patients interactions with multiple care settings (e.g., hospitals, clinics, home, long-term care, etc.) over time. She plans to develop interventions, such as redesigned processes, new technologies, etc., to improve care transitions; this will involve participatory design processes and usability evaluations in her lab and/or simulated settings such as JUMP Simulation. A third area of research includes developing ways to measure team cognition, particular in care transitions. Key components of her research approach include engaging frontline workers (patients and their family as well as various healthcare professionals) and utilizing mixed methods, i.e., both qualitative and quantitative, research designs.

More professionally, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) . Before joining UIUC, I spent a year at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" ,="" target="_blank">Facebook 's Core Systems, working on dealing with data center failures (besides enjoying free food). I spent six wonderful years at sysnet at the University of California San Diego until my rock star advisor kicked me out (I wished to be a tenured grad student 1 ). I worked with NetApp to study production data on tap. I had a short experience at Whova where I learned dedication (try out Whova's virtual conference platform ). I worked in Germany and backpacked Europe for 1.5 years at Goettingen before starting grad school. As a " professor ", my meta-advice is to be serious and sincere to life and work. Winter is coming! Don't fight a fake war or someone else's war. Fight for what really matters to the living or the dead. 1 I am constantly looking for such a job. Please contact me if you have or know one. $ head research_interests The goal of my research is to make computer systems reliable and secure. My mission is to help today's systems defend against all kinds of errors and defects, such as software bugs, configuration errors, and design flaws. I am very happy that some of our work helps improve real software systems ( issues we helped/fixed). I am interested in all black magic. My view of systems research is to build the right swords to kill the dragon (not windmills). $ ls -l publication lrwxrwxrwx 1 tianyin tianyin 4 Feb 30 12:61 publication -> pub.html $ cat teaching Fall 2020 CS 523: Advanced Operating Systems Fall 2020 CS 591(IG): System Reading Group (together with Distributed System Seminar) Fall 2020 CS 591(SE): Software Engineering Seminar Spring 2020 CS 423: Operating System Design Spring 2020 CS 591(IG): System Reading Group (together with Distributed System Seminar) Spring 2020 CS 591(SE): Software Engineering Seminar Fall 2019 CS 523: Advanced Operating Systems Fall 2019 CS 591(SN): System Reading Group Fall 2019 CS 591(SE): Software Engineering Seminar Spring 2019 CS 598: Reliable Software Systems Spring 2019 CS 591: System and Networking Seminar Fall 2018 CS 598: Reliability of Cloud-Scale Systems $ head awards 2020 Facebook Distributed Systems Research Award 2020 Best Paper Award of ASPLOS'20 2019 (Fall) UIUC List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent 2019 (Spring) UIUC List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent 2018 (Fall) UIUC List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent 2017 UCSD CSE Doctoral Award for Research 2016 Jay Lepreau Best Paper Award of OSDI'16 2010 Erasmus Mundus LiSUM Scholarship 2009 Best Paper Award at International Conference on Communications $ head coverage Illinois CS News on Elastic Cuckoo Page Tables Defusing the Configuration Time Bomb ( video ) ( slides ) Validated Configurations with Ciris ( slides ) ( manual ) The Morning Paper's coverage of Taiji ( article ) The Morning Paper's coverage of Maelstrom ( article ) The Morning Paper's coverage of WebRSync ( article ) W3C Authentication References count our access-control-misconfiguration paper at CHI'17.
